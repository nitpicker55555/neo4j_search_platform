122,"Amazon’s robotic fulfillment centers have higher serious injury rates
",IoT,"""Regulation: California Passes Warehouse Worker Bill, Targets Amazon (From 2021 Report)
The bill directly targets Amazon and other warehousing companies that track worker productivity. The bill would prevent employers from comparing health and safety law compliance — yes, bathroom breaks — with warehouse workers’ productive hours, which are increasingly controlled by algorithms. The bill, billed by organizers as the nation's first to address the future of algorithmic jobs, is now heading to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk for signature.

Improvements Amazon has taken during the use of warehouse robots:
1. Install guardrails to separate forklifts from pedestrians, increase safety staffing, and provide health drills.
2. Pilot projects to rotate workers to different jobs to relieve repetitive stress. But sales come first. ""Despite considerable benefits, half of the pilot sites decided to turn off sort rotation during Prime Week,"" Amazon's security team reported in August 2019. A November report said that despite job rotation reducing robotic warehouse productivity Injury rates, but ""adherence is declining.""
3. Pilot project to reduce injuries by blocking off the highest and lowest racks on warehouse shelves, ""optimizing work distribution in employee power zones"" so workers don't have to bend as low or reach as high. However, the pilot project was designed to be used only ""during off-peak periods"". Of the six warehouses testing the pilot, five have suspended the pilot program ahead of Prime Day. The report warned that ""the project is at risk of complete termination"". Amazon declined to provide an update on the current state of the project.
4. Security officer. However, an August 2019 report said security staffing in robotic warehouses was ""very low."" In October of that year, another report again warned about staffing issues in robotic warehouses, including coverage of New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Connecticut ""would leave several locations understaffed.""","
