Victim: Amazon needs to take full responsibility.","Amazon is currently defending itself against a lawsuit that could determine whether it is liable for the actions of its contract delivery drivers.

In March, Ans Rana was going to see his sister’s new house with his father and brother, who was driving a Tesla Model S, when they came upon a disabled vehicle on Interstate 75 outside Atlanta. Rana’s brother slowed to a near stop, but the Amazon delivery van behind them apparently didn’t notice. The driver of the van was going nearly 14 miles per hour over the speed limit, Rana’s lawyers allege in a lawsuit. The van slammed into the rear of the Tesla with such force that it pushed the car into the left lanes of the interstate where it was struck by a Toyota Corolla before hitting the median barrier.

Rana suffered life-threatening injuries, including a traumatic brain injury, and had to be placed on a ventilator. His spinal cord was also damaged, and he hasn’t been able to regain the use of his legs or arms despite months of therapy and rehabilitation.

“I have lost my legs, which I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy,” Rana told Bloomberg.

In June, Rana sued Amazon and its delivery contractor, alleging that the e-commerce giant is responsible for the driver’s actions because of the software the company uses to monitor them. Amazon says it isn’t liable because the driver didn’t work for it but, rather, for Harper Logistics LLC, a contractor that handles deliveries for the tech firm.

Software in play

Yet, Rana’s lawsuit alleges that Amazon is liable because it is ultimately in control of the delivery operation. Amazon closely monitors its drivers through the use of a smartphone app and in-van cameras and sensors in a bid to minimize delivery times and address safety concerns. The company keeps close tabs on a number of actions drivers take, including “backup monitoring, speed, braking, acceleration, cornering, seatbelt usage, phone calls, texting, in-van cameras that use artificial intelligence to detect for yawning, and more,” the lawsuit says.

What’s more, the lawsuit claims that Amazon pushes contractors and drivers to prioritize speed over safety, with Amazon employees sending text messages “complaining that a certain driver is ‘behind the rabbit’ and needs to be ‘rescued’ to ensure that all the packages on Amazon’s route are delivered in compliance with Amazon’s unrealistic and dangerous speed expectations,” it says.

In addition to Amazon, Rana is suing contractor Harper Logistics, driver Bryan Williams, and Old Republic Insurance, the contractor’s insurance company. But it’s unlikely anyone but Amazon will be able to cover Rana’s costs, especially since medical bills already exceed $2 million. Harper Logistics’ insurance policy only covers $1 million for liability, and the company doesn’t own the vans it operates, meaning even if it went bankrupt, it probably couldn’t cover the cost. Williams, who is 23 years old, only makes $15 an hour. Amazon, on the other hand, made over $3 billion in profit last quarter.

“Committed to safety”

Amazon spokeswoman Maria Boschetti told Bloomberg that the company is “committed to the safety of drivers and the communities where we deliver.” She added that Amazon works with delivery contractors to “set realistic expectations that do not place undue pressure on them or their delivery associates.” Boschetti said that the number of incidents per mile for the first nine months of 2021 are down compared with the same period last year.

Delivery drivers typically work 10-hour shifts and deliver around 250 packages, depending on the route. They drive Amazon-branded vans, wear Amazon-branded uniforms, and have to use Amazon’s Flex app, which the lawsuit says “micromanages every imaginable aspect of delivering the packages.”

Amazon first entered the delivery market in 2018, and its contractor-heavy approach almost immediately began running into problems. Drivers were reportedly breaking laws in an attempt to meet what they called unreasonable quotas. Amazon initially had considered training its new fleet of drivers but scrapped those plans to speed up the rollout....","Atlanta, America",2021.03.01,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/157#r61ff874c604d03661118b9ab,,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Victims: Think Amazon is to blame","The pleas to Amazon were explicit. A food preservative sold by the online retailer and other e-commerce sites was being used as a poison to die by suicide.

“Please stop selling this product,” began one review, posted on Amazon in July 2019 by a person who wrote that a niece had used it to kill herself. “I’ve already notified Amazon and they said they would help with this but they have not.”

Since then, suicides linked to sales of the preservative through Amazon have continued. The New York Times identified 10 people who had killed themselves using the chemical compound after buying it through the site in the past two years, including a 16-year-old girl in Ohio, a pair of college freshmen in Pennsylvania and Missouri, and a 27-year-old in Texas whose mother has filed a wrongful-death suit against Amazon. Enough people purchased the preservative to attempt suicide that the company’s algorithm began suggesting other products that customers frequently bought along with it to aid in such efforts.

But when family members left behind and others alerted Amazon to the deaths and to the danger of the sales, the company declined to act.

Now, members of Congress are demanding answers. In a letter sent last week to Andy Jassy, Amazon’s president and chief executive, a bipartisan group of House members sought an accounting of the company’s sales of the preservative and related suicides, details on how the retailer had addressed the dangers, and an explanation of how it had responded to complaints.

The move comes just weeks after publication of a Times investigation that linked a website, which provides explicit instructions on suicide, to a long trail of deaths. Most were from the chemical compound, sold legally in many countries. Site members advised one another on where to buy it and how to use it. Many of those who died — The Times has now identified more than 50 people — were under 25; some were minors.

In response to the article, members of Congress have sought briefings from Google and other tech companies that help make the suicide site accessible, and have asked Attorney General Merrick B. Garland to consider ways to prosecute its operators.

In their letter to Amazon, seven House lawmakers pressed the company, saying that the ease and swiftness with which vulnerable people could buy the compound, called sodium nitrite, was a “grave concern.”

The lawmakers are targeting Amazon for questioning because they believe it to be the e-commerce site most often used to buy the compound and get it quickly delivered, and because of claims by parents and others that product reviews on Amazon warning about the danger were removed, said Representative Lori Trahan, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

In a written response to the lawmakers on Thursday, Brian Huseman, Amazon’s vice president for public policy, extended condolences to families of the dead while defending Amazon’s practices and sales of the compound. He said it was used for a range of purposes and was available from other retailers.

“Amazon makes a wide selection of products available to our customers because we trust that they will use those products as intended by the manufacturers,” he wrote. “Like many widely-available consumer products,” he added, the compound “can unfortunately be misused.”

The lawmakers found the company’s answers insufficient.

“Amazon had the opportunity with their response to collaborate with us on this issue that’s tragically ending the lives of people across our nation,” Representative Trahan said. “Instead, they failed to answer many of our most critical questions”

In email exchanges with The Times, an Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment on the 10 deaths that The Times identified.

Other sites said they had restricted sales of the compound.

Last year, an eBay director wrote to a coroner in England that the company had prohibited global sales of the compound in 2019 after receiving a report of its potential use in suicides. However, The Times identified eight suicides involving eBay sales of the poison since then, including a death the coroner was reviewing.

EBay did not respond to detailed emails and messages seeking comment. But in the letter to the coroner, the eBay director acknowledged that despite the ban, it was possible for “unscrupulous or unaware sellers to circumvent our policies and filters.” He wrote that the company would support government restrictions on online sales of the chemical to prevent future suicides.

In November 2020, Etsy banned sales of the compound, said a spokesperson, who declined to explain why. An Etsy customer posted in May 2018 that he was planning to use his purchase to kill himself. In August 2020, a 35-year-old in Mississippi wrote on the suicide site that he had bought the compound on the site. Days later, he was dead.

The United States is among many countries that allow the chemical compound to be sold as a food preservative, and the federal Food and Drug Administration regulates its use for that purpose.

There is no systematic tracking of suicides involving the compound, but The Times identified dozens of people who had used it since 2018 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada and Australia. More than 300 members of the suicide website had announced intentions to use the compound to kill themselves.

A study of 47 cases of poisoning by the preservative reported to the National Poison Data System over a five-year period found that suicide attempts with it had been increasing since 2017. A 2020 article in The Journal of Emergency Medicine warned that because the compound “is readily accessible through online vendors, and is being circulated through various suicide forums,” emergency rooms might see more patients who have used it.

Dr. Kyle Pires, a resident emergency room physician at Yale University Hospital who treated a 28-year-old woman who had bought the compound on Amazon, wrote in the journal Clinical Toxicology about her death and the recent rise in suicides by this method. The article, published last May, said policymakers should be aware of the preservative’s use in suicides, and encouraged emergency rooms to stock doses of an antidote, methylene blue, that can prevent death if administered early.

In an interview, Dr. Pires said that businesses should be able to buy the preservative, but sales to individuals should be banned.

“There’s an argument that it’s a slippery slope to restrict sales of something that is legal just because some people are using it to kill themselves,” Dr. Pires said. But, he added, “this is a cost-benefit analysis of a small number of hobbyists using this chemical to cure meat at home versus these growing numbers of young people, including teenagers, using it to kill themselves. For me, it’s an easy calculation.”

In the United Kingdom, coroners for nearly two years have been highlighting suicides involving online purchases of the preservative and asking the government to take action. A cross-government group is working with businesses — including manufacturers and online suppliers of the preservative — to reduce access and end some sales to individuals, according to a spokeswoman for the government’s Department of Health and Social Care. The United Kingdom already requires sellers to inform law enforcement officials of any suspicious purchases of the compound, though it’s unclear how often such reports are made.

Some businesses have gone further.

Metalchem, a British vendor, stopped selling the compound to the public in April 2020 after learning that it had been used for suicide. Mike Keay, the company’s chief executive, also notified an English coroner that he had asked other businesses to stop selling the compound online “when the reason for the purchase cannot be reasonably ascertained.”

“Sadly, nearly two years later and the preservative is still available online, even on Amazon, with worldwide shipping,” Mr. Keay wrote in an email to The Times this week.

In the United States, Amazon continued to receive complaints about its sales of the compound — including, in May 2020, from someone whose father had just used it to die; in October 2020, from the grieving mother of an 18-year-old who had killed himself; and last year from Ruth Scott of Schertz, Texas, who is now suing the company.

Her 27-year-old son, Mikael, who had struggled with depression, learned about the compound on the suicide website and bought it on Amazon. He killed himself in December 2020.

Ms. Scott said she had reached out five times to inform Amazon, only to hit brick walls. A customer service representative wrote to her that her message would be passed along.

“I am sorry for your loss,” said the email, which was reviewed by The Times. “But at least your son is now on our God’s hand.”

After Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer for Ms. Scott, wrote to Amazon’s general counsel and implored the company to remove the product from its platform, lawyers for Amazon pointed out a Texas law and court decisions protecting the seller of a legal product used in a suicide.

“They know it’s killing people,” Ms. Scott said in an interview. “They are fully aware. They just don’t care.”...","Pennsylvania and Missouri, America",2019.07.01,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/156,,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Social media posts, including from Crystal Kolden, a professor of forest sciences at UC Merced, have condemned the service for redirecting travelers away from closed highways to potentially precarious shortcuts. “This is an abject failure,” tweeted Kolden Monday evening. “You are sending people up a poorly maintained forest road to their death in a severe blizzard.”

A screenshot she shared showed directions through Marysville Road, a fairly narrow, two-lane path going through the Tahoe National Forest.

(Kolden did not immediately respond to a request for comment from SFGATE.)

Other dispatches from Twitter allege that the service — particularly its mobile app — directed people to closed-off highways, mountain passes and lakeside roads to get around. This is in direct contrast to Caltrans' messaging to avoid workarounds. Caltrans District 3 spokesperson Steve Nelson told SFGATE on Monday that they were seeing drivers trying to skirt highway closures with side streets. ""They’ll take side roads and try and sneak past the closures, and that never ends well,"" he said.

Kolden’s post got the attention of Google engineer Sören Meyer-Eppler, who said on Twitter he worked on “this problem” in the past and explained the challenges of guiding people through mountain roads. He also defended the service, noting the ""trade-off"" of offering convenient driving directions and fully accurate ones.

But thousands of others may still remain behind bars because of fundamental flaws in the Justice Department's method for deciding who can take the early-release track. The biggest flaw: persistent racial disparities that put Black and brown people at a disadvantage.

In a report issued days before Christmas in 2021, the department said its algorithmic tool for assessing the risk that a person in prison would return to crime produced uneven results. The algorithm, known as Pattern, overpredicted the risk that many Black, Hispanic and Asian people would commit new crimes or violate rules after leaving prison. At the same time, it also underpredicted the risk for some inmates of color when it came to possible return to violent crime.

""From the beginning, civil rights groups cautioned Congress and the Justice Department that use of a risk assessment tool to make these determinations would lead to racial disparities,"" said Aamra Ahmad, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.

""The Justice Department found that only 7% of Black people in the sample were classified as minimum level risk compared to 21% of white people,"" she added. ""This indicator alone should give the Department of Justice great pause in moving forward.""

The rule of unintended consequences

Risk assessment tools are common in many states. But critics said Pattern is the first time the federal justice system is using an algorithm with such high stakes.

Congress passed the First Step Act in 2018 with huge bipartisan majorities. It's designed to prepare people in prison for life afterward by offering credits toward early release for working or taking life skills and other classes while behind bars.

Lawmakers like Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and John Cornyn of Texas took inspiration from similar criminal justice reforms in states, which they said led to drops in both prison populations and crime. The senators pointed out that some 9 in 10 people in prison eventually return home, and they contended that preparing them for release made good sense for formerly incarcerated people and for public safety.

Only inmates who pose a low or minimal risk of returning to crime can qualify for the programs, with that risk level determined using the Pattern algorithm.

""The significance of this risk assessment tool is that it divides all federal prisoners essentially into two groups: people who can get credit for doing this programming and get out early, and people who can't,"" said Jim Felman, an attorney in Tampa, Fla., who has been following the First Step Act for years.

The implementation has been rocky. The Justice Department finished the first version of Pattern in a rush because of a tight deadline from Congress.

It then had to make tweaks after finding Pattern suffered from math and human errors.

About 14,000 men and women in federal prison still wound up in the wrong risk categories. There were big disparities for people of color.

""The legislation, I think, came from a good place,"" said Melissa Hamilton, a professor of law and criminal justice at the University of Surrey who studies risk assessments. ""It's just the rule of unintended consequences is not really realizing the impediments it was going to have.""

Risk assessment tool ""sounds highly technical, but it's not""

""You use a term like 'risk assessment tool,' it has this patina of science, it sounds highly technical, but it's not,"" said Patricia Richman, who works on national policy issues for the Federal Public and Community Defenders. ""A risk assessment tool is just a series of policy decisions.""

Those policy decisions are made by determining what counts as a risk factor and by how much.

Criminal history can be a problem, for example, because law enforcement has a history of overpolicing some communities of color. Other factors such as education level and whether someone paid restitution to their victims can intersect with race and ethnicity, too.

In its December report, the Justice Department concluded that some of the disparities could be reduced, ""but not without tradeoffs"" such as less accurate risk predictions. The department also said using race as a factor in the algorithm could trigger other legal concerns.

Still, it is consulting with experts about making the algorithm fairer and another overhaul of Pattern is already underway.

Attorney General Merrick Garland has directed the department to look for ways to assess racial bias and make the tool more transparent, a spokeswoman said.

One option is to adjust the cutoff points between the risk categories, allowing more prisoners to earn credits for release, which would ""maximize access to First Step Act relief while ensuring public safety,"" she said.

Ultimately, Garland will have to sign off on a new version. Then, Justice has to reevaluate the 14,000 people in prison who got lumped into the wrong category.

""This is just one example of the ways that harmful artificial intelligence systems are being rolled out in everything from the criminal legal system to employment decisions to who gets access to housing and social benefits,"" said Sasha Costanza-Chock, director of research and design for the Algorithmic Justice League, which studies the social implications of artificial intelligence.

Costanza-Chock said the burden is on the Justice Department to prove the Pattern tool doesn't have racist and sexist outcomes.

""Especially when systems are high risk and affect people's liberty, we need much clearer and stronger oversight,"" said Costanza-Chock.

Looking for resolution

Felman, the Florida lawyer working with the American Bar Association, worried that the tool will continue to put many prisoners of color at a disadvantage.

""We will start to see more prisoners get out early,"" he said. ""My concern is that the color of their skin will not be reflective of fairness.""

The ACLU's Ahmad said she's seen enough.

""There are no technical fixes to these problems that could make Pattern and similar tools safe and fair to use,"" Ahmad said. ""We would urge the Justice Department to suspend the use of Pattern until it can adequately address these concerns.""

Hamilton, who studies risk assessments, thinks the Pattern tool may be worth saving. Consider the alternative, she said: decisions made by people who have all kinds of biases.

""So that's the unfortunate thing is, it's better than gut instinct of the very flawed humans that we all are, and can we improve it more than marginally, and that's what we're all working on?"" Hamilton said....

The defendant appears to be the first person to be charged with a felony in the United States for a fatal crash involving a motorist who was using a partially automated driving system. Los Angeles County prosecutors filed the charges in October, but they came to light only last week.

The driver, Kevin George Aziz Riad, 27, has pleaded not guilty. Riad, a limousine service driver, is free on bail while the case is pending.

The misuse of Autopilot, which can control steering, speed and braking, has occurred on numerous occasions and is the subject of investigations by two federal agencies. The filing of charges in the California crash could serve notice to drivers who use systems like Autopilot that they cannot rely on them to control vehicles.

The criminal charges aren’t the first involving an automated driving system, but they are the first to involve a widely used driver technology. Authorities in Arizona filed a charge of negligent homicide in 2020 against a driver Uber had hired to take part in the testing of a fully autonomous vehicle on public roads. The Uber vehicle, an SUV with the human backup driver on board, struck and killed a pedestrian.

By contrast, Autopilot and other driver-assist systems are widely used on roads across the world. An estimated 765,000 Tesla vehicles are equipped with it in the United States alone.

In the Tesla crash, police said a Model S was moving at a high speed when it left a freeway and ran a red light in the Los Angeles suburb of Gardena and struck a Honda Civic at an intersection on Dec. 29, 2019. Two people who were in the Civic, Gilberto Alcazar Lopez and Maria Guadalupe Nieves-Lopez died at the scene. Riad and a woman in the Tesla were hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries.

Criminal charging documents do not mention Autopilot. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which sent investigators to the crash, confirmed last week that Autopilot was in use in the Tesla at the time of the crash.

Riad’s defense attorney did not respond to requests for comment last week, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office declined to discuss the case. Riad’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 23.

NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board have been reviewing the widespread misuse of Autopilot by drivers, whose overconfidence and inattention have been blamed for multiple crashes, including fatal ones. In one crash report, the NTSB referred to its misuse as “automation complacency.”

The agency said that in a 2018 crash in Culver City, California, in which a Tesla hit a firetruck, the design of the Autopilot system had “permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.” No one was hurt in that crash.

Last May, a California man was arrested after officers noticed his Tesla moving down a freeway with the man in the back seat and no one behind the steering wheel.

Teslas that have had Autopilot in use also have hit a highway barrier or tractor-trailers that were crossing roads. NHTSA has sent investigation teams to 26 crashes involving Autopilot since 2016, involving at least 11 deaths.

Messages have been left seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department. Since the Autopilot crashes began, Tesla has updated the software to try to make it harder for drivers to abuse it. It’s also tried to improve Autopilot’s ability to detect emergency vehicles.

The company has said that Autopilot and a more sophisticated “Full Self-Driving” system cannot drive themselves and that drivers must pay attention and be ready to react at anytime. “Full Self-Driving” is being tested by hundreds of Tesla owners on public roads in the U.S.

Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies automated vehicles, said this is the first U.S. case to his knowledge in which serious criminal charges were filed in a fatal crash involving a partially automated driver-assist system. Tesla, he said, could be “criminally, civilly or morally culpable” if it is found to have put a dangerous technology on the road.

Donald Slavik, a Colorado lawyer who has served as a consultant in automotive technology lawsuits, including many against Tesla, said he, too, is unaware of any previous felony charges being filed against a U.S. driver who was using partially automated driver technology involved in a fatal crash.

The families of Lopez and Nieves-Lopez have sued Tesla and Riad in separate lawsuits. They have alleged negligence by Riad and have accused Tesla of selling defective vehicles that can accelerate suddenly and that lack an effective automatic emergency braking system. A joint trial is scheduled for mid-2023.

Lopez’s family, in court documents, alleges that the car “suddenly and unintentionally accelerated to an excessive, unsafe and uncontrollable speed.” Nieves-Lopez’s family further asserts that Riad was an unsafe driver, with multiple moving infractions on his record, and couldn’t handle the high-performance Tesla.

Separately, NHTSA is investigating a dozen crashes in which a Tesla on Autopilot ran into several parked emergency vehicles. In the crashes under investigation, at least 17 people were injured and one person was killed.

Asked about the manslaughter charges against Riad, the agency issued a statement saying there is no vehicle on sale that can drive itself. And whether or not a car is using a partially automated system, the agency said, “every vehicle requires the human driver to be in control at all times.”

NHTSA added that all state laws hold human drivers responsible for operation of their vehicles. Though automated systems can help drivers avoid crashes, the agency said, the technology must be used responsibly.

2. SoftBank CEO: SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son fed the Pepper hype machine back in 2014. ""Today might become a day that people 100, 200, or 300 years later would remember as a historic day,"" he said during an ceremony introducing Pepper. The first batch of 1,000 robots then sold out in one minute.",Negative,There are currently no relevant measures,"TOKYO—Having a robot read scripture to mourners seemed like a cost-effective idea to the people at Nissei Eco Co., a plastics manufacturer with a sideline in the funeral business.

The company hired child-sized robot Pepper, clothed it in the vestments of Buddhist clergy and programmed it to chant several sutras, or Buddhist scriptures, depending on the sect of the deceased.

Alas, the robot, made by SoftBank Group Corp., kept breaking down during practice runs. “What if it refused to operate in the middle of a ceremony?” said funeral-business manager Osamu Funaki. “It would be such a disaster.”

Pepper was fired. The company ended its lease of the robot and sent it back to the manufacturer. After a rash of similar mishaps across Japan, in which Pepper botched its job at a nursing home and gave baseball fans a creepy feeling, some people are saying the humanoid itself will need a funeral soon.

“Because it has the shape of a person, people expect the intelligence of a human,” said Takayuki Furuta, head of the Future Robotics Technology Center at Chiba Institute of Technology, which wasn’t involved in Pepper’s development. “The level of the technology completely falls short of that. It’s like the difference between a toy car and an actual car.”

The robotics unit of SoftBank, a Tokyo-based technology investor, said in late June that it halted production of Pepper last year and was planning to restructure its global robotics teams, including a French unit involved in Pepper’s development.

Still, the company says the machine shouldn’t be sent to the product graveyard. Spokeswoman Ai Kitamura said Pepper is SoftBank’s icon and still doing good work as a teacher and a temperature taker at hospitals. She declined to comment on any of its individual mishaps.

SoftBank introduced the humanoid to the world in 2014 and started selling it the next year. “Today might become a day that people 100, 200 or 300 years later would remember as a historic day,” SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said at the introduction.

SoftBank sold the robots to individuals for about $2,000, plus monthly fees for subscription services, and rented them to businesses starting at $550 a month.

Japan has had a love affair with humanlike robots going back to Astro Boy, a robot featured in a 1960s animated television series, but there have also been breakups.

Honda Motor Co. ’s Asimo once kicked a soccer ball to then-President Barack Obama. Toshiba Corp.’s Aiko Chihira, an android with a woman’s name and appearance, briefly worked as a department store receptionist. After a while, both disappeared.

More recently, a Japanese hotel chain created a robot-operated hotel, with dinosaur-shaped robots handling front-desk duties, only to reverse course after the plan failed to save money and created more work for humans.

Pepper was given a perky demeanor and programmed to grasp human emotions and engage in basic conversation. It starred in some early demonstrations. But like a candidate who puts on a fine performance at his job interview only to drive his bosses crazy later, Pepper lacked the skills it said it had, say some of his managers.

In 2016, a Tokyo-area nursing-home operator called Ittokai introduced three units of Pepper, each at a cost of around $900 a month, to lead singing and exercises for elderly people at the home.

“Users got excited to have it early on because of its novelty,” said Masataka Iida, an executive at the company. “But they lost interest sooner than expected.” Mr. Iida said Pepper’s repertoire of exercise moves was limited and, owing to mechanical errors, it sometimes took unplanned breaks in the middle of its shift. After three years, the company pulled the plug.

At Mizuho Financial Group Inc., reporters were invited to a ceremony in 2015 when Pepper was introduced as a Mizuho employee and stationed in the bank lobby, with an employee card hanging around its neck, to recommend financial products to customers. Today Pepper is no longer with the bank, according to a spokeswoman who declined to elaborate.

SoftBank also touted Pepper as a companion for the home. The initial batch of 1,000 units sold out in a minute despite the hefty price tag.

Technology journalist Tsutsumu Ishikawa said he “fell in love at first sight” after seeing Mr. Son, the SoftBank chief, present a futuristic picture of living with a chatty Pepper.

After arriving at the Ishikawa home, however, Pepper couldn’t recognize the faces of family members or carry on a proper conversation, said Mr. Ishikawa. The robot, connected to the cloud, is supposed to remember the family even after a breakdown, Mr. Ishikawa says, but when Pepper returned home after the repair of a sensor, Pepper greeted him, “Nice to meet you!”

He shipped the robot back to SoftBank in 2018 after spending at least $9,000 over the three-year life of his subscription services agreement; he wasn’t eligible for any form of refund.

“It was such a waste of money. I still regret it,” he said.

On flea-market sites, old Peppers are available for a few hundred dollars, typically without SoftBank service contracts and meant as home or office decoration or playthings for children to take apart.

Industry watchers say home smart speakers or smartphone assistants carry out many of Pepper’s functions more reliably and at lower cost. Dr. Furuta, the robot technology expert, said if Pepper were meant as entertainment, it would have been better if it looked like a dog or stuffed animal to avoid raising expectations.

Some companies are taking that advice. One former SoftBank Robotics executive leads a startup that makes a round-shaped pet-like robot called Lovot. It is supposed to cheer up humans but isn’t meant to help them get work done. Panasonic Corp.’s Nicobo, introduced this year, is designed as a vulnerable creature that draws out its owner’s caring instinct. Its abilities include making sounds of flatulence.

SoftBank Robotics says Pepper still works teaching children and entertaining diners at a Pepper-themed cafe in Tokyo, among other jobs. And during the pandemic, Pepper found a niche as a concierge at hotels where Covid-19 patients were housed and human staff were trying to keep their distance.

Pepper may also make an appearance at the Olympic Games that kick off later this month in Tokyo, but SoftBank Robotics declined to make any details public.

The company has dispatched 100 Pepper cheerleaders to the home of SoftBank’s professional baseball team, the SoftBank Hawks, in Fukuoka in the south of Japan. The stadium is sparsely filled because of Covid-19 restrictions. Ms. Kitamura, the SoftBank Robotics spokeswoman, said the robots could raise enthusiasm without adding to infection risk.

Online, though, commenters said the scene reminded them of a dystopia. Hirofumi Miyato, 56, of Tokyo, was watching a game on television and saw the Pepper group in team uniforms moving their arms in unison. He wasn’t inspired to cheer along.

“It reminded me of a military parade in North Korea or China,” Mr. Miyato said. “It felt creepy.”...","Tokoyo, Japan",2021.07.03,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/152,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first time the state of California has suspended such a permit.",Autonomous driving technology is not mature enough,Data modeling,uncertain,Negative,uncertain,"Following an accident on October 28, 2021 while operating a vehicle in autonomous mode, Pony.ai‘s driverless testing permit has been suspended by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). This is the first time the state of California has suspended such a permit.

The accident occurred at 10:50 a.m. on October 28. The autonomous vehicle was being tested on roads in Fremont, Calif., which is where Pony.ai’s U.S. headquarters is located. You can read the full report of the accident on the CA DMV website. Below is a description of the accident:

“On October 28, 2021, after turning right onto Fremont Blvd from Cushing Pkwy, the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle (“Pony.ai AV”) performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode. While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a center divider on Fremont Blvd. and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. Fremont Police Department were called to report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the damaged sign.”

There have been plenty of other reported crashes involving autonomous vehicles. But this incident stands out because the vehicle was operating in autonomous mode and didn’t involve any other vehicle.

The Robot Report reached out to both the CA DMV and Pony.ai on December 13, 2021 for more information about the reinstatement process. Neither organization responded to us, however, Reuters obtained the following statement from the DMV: “On Nov. 19, the DMV notified Pony.ai that the department is suspending its driverless testing permit, effective immediately, following a reported solo collision in Fremont, California, on Oct. 28.”

Six months ago, Pony.ai became the eighth company to receive a driverless testing permit in California. The other companies are Apollo, AutoX, Cruise, Nuro, Waymo, WeRide and Zoox. Cruise, Nuro and Waymo are the only companies with permits allowing them to deploy autonomous vehicles in commercial operations. Cruise and Waymo are developing robotaxis to transport passengers, while Nuro is developing an autonomous delivery vehicle.

Pony.ai has 10 Hyundai Kona electric vehicles registered under its driverless testing permit. According to the CA DMV, the suspension doesn’t impact Pony.ai’s permit for testing with a human safety driver.

Pony.ai IPO falls apart

Pony.ai is a startup that operates in both China and the U.S. Most of its operations, including its autonomous trucks, take place in China. It hoped to go public in the U.S. via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that would have raised an additional $1.2 billion in funding.

But in August 2021, Pony.ai suspended those plans with VectoIQ Acquisition. According to Reuters, this deal fell through after Pony.ai “failed to gain assurances from Beijing that it would not become a target of a crackdown against Chinese technology companies.”

Pony.ai recently lost at least three key executives following the merger of its autonomous car and truck R&D teams. Zhenhao Pan was the CTO of Pony’s trucking business; Youhan Sun led planning and control for Pony’s trucking business in the U.S.; and Sun Haowen, former head of planning and control for Pony’s autonomous driving in China.

Expanding in China

Pony.ai was granted a license by the city of Shenzhen to start autonomous driving tests on the city’s open roads. The 12-square-mile (20 square kilometer) pilot zone in Beijing covers major subway stations, residential areas, and tech parks. With the addition of Shenzhen, Pony.ai said it now performs autonomous driving tests or autonomous services in seven Chinese cities.

On November 25, 2021, Pony.ai announced it received approval to run paid autonomous robotaxi services in southeastern Beijing. Beijing, China’s capital city, is the first Tier-1 city in China to approve robotaxi commercialization, allowing self-driving companies to charge for their autonomous services....","Califonia, America",2021.10.28,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/151,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,‘I felt colossally naive’: the backlash against the birth control app,Smart Healthcare,uncertain,Natural Cycles,Natural Cycles users,"Natural Cycles was hailed as a stress-free, hormone-free contraceptive. Then women began reporting unwanted pregnancies.","The technology of the software is not mature enough, and people are too dependent on the content that appears on the software","Data acquisition,Data modeling,Behaviour nudging",uncertain,Negative,uncertain,"Natural Cycles was hailed as a stress-free, hormone-free contraceptive. Then women began reporting unwanted pregnancies.

Last summer I had an abortion. Statistically unremarkable, yes, but mine wasn’t because of a split condom or a missed pill. I was four months into a tense relationship with a much-hyped Swedish “digital contraceptive”, a smartphone app called Natural Cycles. I had spent my 20s on the pill, but hated not knowing whether my emotional state was down to artificial hormones or not. My boyfriend and I had been together for eight months, and I was desperately seeking something new, something that wouldn’t make me feel so anxious.

That’s when the adverts started following me around on social media: glowing women reclining in Scandi bedrooms, all pale grey sheets and dappled light, brandishing basal thermometers and telling me how great it felt to “get to know yourself better”. Natural Cycles’ ads promised the “world’s first contraceptive app”, something “natural, hormone free & non-invasive”. I could start using it without a two-week wait for a doctor’s appointment and so, in a fug of hormones and frustration, I bought a subscription. I was sold on shiny promises, a sleek user interface and the fact that a former Cern physicist, Elina Berglund, was at the company’s helm. But four months in, it failed. Berglund helped discover the Higgs boson; but it turns out her algorithm couldn’t map my menstrual cycle.

Femtech, or female health technology, is going through a boom phase, with an estimated $1bn of investment raised worldwide in the last three years. Apps such as Clue, Dot, Glow and Spot On are all popular period trackers, but Natural Cycles is the only one certified as contraception. In 2017, it was approved for use across the EU, getting the green light from the German inspection and certification organisation, Tüv Süd.

How does it work? It comprises an app, an annual subscription of about £60, and a thermometer accurate to two decimal points (free in the post). You input your temperature as soon as you wake up, and the app makes predictions about your fertility each day: green for “go have unprotected sex”, red for “not unless you want a baby” (you can also use the app to plan a pregnancy). No hormones, no implant and, supposedly, no stress. It has its own language: users are known as “Cyclers”, and useful information is available via a “Cyclerpedia”. It seems as easy as ordering a takeaway or a taxi from your phone; of course there’s an app for fertility, too.

Natural Cycles has now registered more than 700,000 users from more than 200 countries, 125,000 of them in the UK. But its certification as contraception is under review in Sweden, where the company and its married co-founders are based. In January, a major Swedish hospital reported that 37 of the 668 women who had sought an abortion there between September and December 2017 were using Natural Cycles as their sole birth control, and the Medical Products Agency of Sweden began to investigate [*See Update below]. Natural Cycles has responded that the number of pregnancies is proportional to the registered number of Swedish users and “in line with our expectations”; but as someone who didn’t report my own pregnancy last year, keeping it secret even from my parents, I wonder how many more there have been.

It wasn’t the stigma that kept me quiet, or the sadness, though that trailed me all summer like the sinister melody of an ice-cream van. It wasn’t the fact that being 28, in a stable-seeming relationship and game for motherhood in a couple of years, I lacked an explanation other than precarious finances and a relationship just shy of its first anniversary (those are excellent reasons). No, my silence was because I felt colossally naive. I’d used the app in the way I do most of the technology in my life: not quite knowing how it works, but taking for granted that it does. Speaking to others who bought the app as contraception (about 75% of Natural Cycles’ total user base, according to its CEO), it seems that many feel the same.

I spoke to Amy, 29, who was fed up with hormones when she started using the app as her sole birth control. Three months later, she was pregnant, a “massive shock”. Though she admits she may have made a mistake, she can’t pinpoint the error. “You’re told all you need to know is yourself. I believed in it the same way I did the pill and thought I did everything right.” Having already booked her wedding, she went ahead with the pregnancy, giving birth weeks before she walked down the aisle. “It’s supposed to make you feel like you have more control, but in fact it did the opposite: when I fell pregnant it felt like a decision was taken out of our hands. It wasn’t how we’d have planned it, and I don’t recommend weddings two weeks postpartum, but I’m lucky it was something we wanted in the long run.”

Marie, 30, first heard about the app when she saw an Instagram post about it (search for Natural Cycles and you will find hundreds of posts by influencers telling you how it changed their lives). “I didn’t spot the hashtag at the very end of the caption which said that it was a sponsored post,” she says. She had been taking Yasmin, a commonly prescribed contraceptive pill, for six years when she made the switch, hoping that the app would be a reliable and easy alternative. A year into a relationship, and eight months into using Natural Cycles, Marie realised she was pregnant. She had an abortion that proved traumatic, contributing to the breakdown of the relationship and leading her into what she describes as “a pit of despair”.

She didn’t want to tell anyone about it. She’d had an abortion once before, when a morning-after pill didn’t work, but this time she felt ashamed: “I felt like I’d acted alone in the decision to use the app and had been overly trusting. But I was also angry that I’d been treated like a consumer, not a patient.”

Like Marie, I didn’t go to my GP before I switched to the app, probably because I subconsciously knew he’d advise against it. In many ways he knows me better than any algorithm can. He put me on the pill at 18 because I had an irregular cycle. I later learned I had polycystic ovary syndrome, which I now know makes me a terrible candidate for Natural Cycles, because my ovulation is unpredictable and erratic.

A year earlier, before I’d heard of the app, I had been to see a gynaecologist to discuss birth control, thinking I wanted a non-hormonal coil fitted. It was the first time a medical professional had helped me to truly understand the extent of my options. She drew me a set of coordinates and plotted each option available (no app got a mention) to show me the benefits and drawbacks. Spotting v cramps, depression v maintenance, long- v short-term.

I’d read grim things about the hormonal vaginal ring – a widely shared article about a young, fit woman who died after a blood clot – but agreed, based on what she felt would suit me best, to try it. We laughed at how it’s impossible to research any birth control online without encountering horror stories. I told myself I would trust a professional and cease my Googling as it only induced anxiety; but after a few paranoid weeks wearing compression socks to avoid blood clots, I was done.

None of the posts on my social-media feed suggested that being a “Cycler” would be such a frustrating, often daunting commitment. One paid-for post I saw featured a still life of a puppy, a pair of on-trend headphones, a self-help book and a thermometer, with a 250-word caption starting with “5 things I need in the morning. Cuddles from Bee [the dog], tea, music, positive quotes and the first thing I do when I wake up – my Natural Cycles thermometer.” But I found that taking your temperature regularly is not so easy. The number of times I leapt out of bed bleary-eyed and needing to pee, then realised I hadn’t first taken my temperature, meant I started waking up in the middle of the night to pre-emptively urinate, panicked about missing my measuring window in the morning. On the pill, it didn’t matter if I’d just woken up, was lying down or standing up when I took it. With Natural Cycles, the slightest motion seemed to count. It was comedic until it became tragic; I got pregnant when the predictions of fertile and infertile changed back and forth in one day, turning from green to red, after I had unprotected sex.

I now know that the ideal Cycler is a narrow, rather old-fashioned category of person. She’s in a stable relationship with a stable lifestyle. (Shift-workers, world-travellers, the sickly, the stressed, insomniacs and sluts be advised.) She’s about 29, and rarely experiences fevers or hangovers. She is savvy about fertility and committed to the effort required to track hers. I could add that her phone is never lost or broken and she’s never late to work. She wakes up at the same time every day, with a charged phone and a thermometer within reach.

“From the information provided by Natural Cycles, I expected that my body temperature would follow a clear pattern and that I would be able to pinpoint five days in every four-week cycle that I was fertile,” says Lucy, 32. She switched from the pill after becoming concerned about an increased risk of breast cancer, after one of her friends was diagnosed. “I did feel like I was getting to understand my body better, but soon realised that I can’t pinpoint when I wake up each day. Some mornings I stir at 5am, roll over and try to sleep for another hour or two, sometimes I toss and turn from 2am to 6am and then fall asleep, and so on.” Her readings were erratic. “I couldn’t see a pattern and this undermined my confidence. After using Natural Cycles for three full cycles, I found I was still having eight to 10 red [ie possibly fertile] days per cycle.” After four months, she decided it was no better than using a calendar and went back on the pill.

No form of contraception is 100% effective; most are assessed according to two metrics: typical use and perfect use. “Typical” reflects a margin for human error; “perfect” is when it’s used absolutely correctly. With perfect use, Natural Cycles scores as 99% effective, with just 1% of women becoming pregnant. With regular use, according to clinical studies carried out by the company (self-selecting, rather than randomised control trials), that drops to 93%. This is often cited by the company as favourable compared with the pill (91% effective with “regular use”). But, unlike the pill, you’re not covered for every day of the month. You have to abstain or use other contraception on fertile days. And in the first few months, as the app “gets to know you”, these are pretty near continuous.

When I talk to Raoul Scherwitzl, the CEO and co-founder of Natural Cycles, he is charming and sincere and calls at precisely the appointed hour, not a second early or late. “My wife and I represent a typical user-couple,” he says. “Elina was on hormonal birth control for 10 years and we knew we wanted children, but in a couple of years. We both had PhDs in physics and [Elina was] working at Cern, dealing with messy, fluctuating data, trying to look for the Higgs boson, which is basically looking for a signal amid noise. We started applying the same statistical methods to pinpoint my wife’s ovulation amid her varying temperatures. We read up on the literature and developed an algorithm which our colleagues started using, too. We were running it on the Cern servers and then using Google spreadsheets. We saw it as an unmet need. There was a lack of choice and we wanted to innovate in an important field.”

I tell Scherwitzl that, though the need is real, after purchasing the app, caveat after caveat revealed itself. I didn’t know it would take months to become reliable. “The algorithm is cautious by design,” he explains. “It gives red days unless it’s sure.” I tell him how I got pregnant, when the predictions changed after I’d had sex. Scherwitzl empathises (“I am sorry to hear that”) but says that as well as “downsides”, there is “a huge upside with all the happy users” and that “the most important thing is to use protection on red days: it relies on that”.Has the company adapted its communication strategy to reflect the experience of users who have become pregnant? “At the core, our messaging has always been grounded on facts but we do evolve what we say. We used to state the 93% figure but without the right context, so there were certain expectations on the product.” The 93% figure comes from existing users responding to the company’s calls for participants, research that has been criticised by a reproductive health expert as “inappropriate and misleading”, and more like “marketing research” than a medical study. But Scherwitzl insists the data is robust, and preferable to a medicalised control test. “There are pros and cons to that type of study, and in our view this reflects the world better.”

What about the targeted advertising? Isn’t it strange to get social-media influencers (one prominent Swedish blogger is now an investor) to promote a medical product? He doesn’t think so. “Social media allows us to control the narrative because there’s lots of misinformation out there, not just with us but with every type of birth control. We can also target the right age group.”

The investigation by Sweden’s medical watchdog is now six months in, and has started its second phase, reviewing marketing material, past clinical studies and fresh user data. Reports of unwanted pregnancies have not, however, had any negative effect on the business.

In a 2016 interview I wish I’d read, Scherwitzl’s wife and business partner Elina Berglund described her ideal user as a woman who is planning to have children at some point, and who would like a break from hormonal contraception before trying.

Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockhom was part of a team of researchers hired by Berglund pointed out that it’s not a good option for women who want to entirely avoid a pregnancy, she said. But somehow this message has got lost in Natural Cycles’ marketing; this is very much not what the word “contraception” means to me.

Indeed, on the section of the Natural Cycles website aimed at medical professionals there is a “decision tree” for doctors considering prescribing the app as birth control. Is the patient over 18? Is she satisfied with her current birth control? If the answers to those questions are yes and no, then the third is: would she be “devastated” to get pregnant within the next year? If the answer is yes, the doctor is told not to prescribe the app. Perhaps those questions should be compulsory when you click through on a Natural Cycle link.

Instead, the app assumes the intimate voice of a trusted doctor, mixed with the sort of gamified messaging you find on other apps. You might get an update saying, “Nice curves! You have a nice and smooth temperature curve with small day-to-day variations. Keep up the good work!” The company’s social media is peppered with hashtags such as #yourcyclematters and #wakeupmeasuregetup. The perkiness is grating – even the thermometer bears the slogan “Good morning!” – and can be pressurising, too. One woman I spoke to who bought Natural Cycles to try to plan a pregnancy told the company she wanted to leave after six months, as the daily tracking was too stressful. She emailed to ask for a break, “for emotional wellbeing”. A customer service manager responded to say she could cancel, and reactivate when she wanted, but that “I took a quick look at your data, and in terms of ovulation everything looks good!”, adding, “You do not need to worry about losing any data – we never delete anything!” Those exclamation marks don’t make such reassurances any less creepy.

Perhaps this false sense of intimacy is why it felt more like a betrayal to find myself pregnant than if the pill were at fault. After the abortion, the honeymoon period of my relationship ended abruptly. It felt like we’d begun our romantic race with a false start. I stopped using the thermometer and went back on the pill, but it took me a while longer to part ways with the app. I deleted it from my phone, only to realise the direct debit was rolling and non-refundable. I have just been sent another £60 bill, for a contraceptive app I no longer use, that got me pregnant. But it’s not just the money that bothers me – it’s the reminder that I put so much faith in a technology that in the end relied on something as unreliable as my body. What’s the hashtag for that?...",Global,2018.07.21,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/150,,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""If you want to do iBuying and you're going to make thousands of offers every day you have to be really good at valuing homes, not only today but three to six months in the future,""  ""And that's an art and a science.""",Negative,uncertain,"In February, Zillow appeared so confident in its ability to use artificial intelligence to estimate the value of homes that it announced a new option: for certain homes, its so-called ""Zestimate"" would also represent an initial cash offer from the company to purchase the property.

The move, touted by a company exec at the time as ""an exciting advancement,"" was intended to streamline the process for homeowners considering selling to Zillow as part of its home-flipping business. Zillow promoted this option as a way to make it convenient to sell a home while minimizing interactions with others during the pandemic. Just eight months later, however, the company is shutting down that business, Zillow Offers, entirely.

The decision, announced last week, marks a stunning defeat for Zillow. The real estate listing company took a $304 million inventory write-down in the third quarter, which it blamed on having recently purchased homes for prices that are higher than it thinks it can sell them. The company saw its stock plunge and it now plans to cut 2,000 jobs, or 25% of its staff.

The fallout from this business venture doesn't just point to the challenges in buying and selling homes for profit, however. It also highlights how hard it is to use AI to help make expensive, real-world decisions, particularly in an ever-changing market that can be hard to predict months or even weeks out, and with prices that can be based as much on feel as on clear data points. Zillow CEO and cofounder Rich Barton explained the shuttering of Zillow Offers by citing ""unpredictability in forecasting home prices"" that ""far exceeds"" what the company had expected.

The ""iBuyer"" model used by Zillow and other other real estate companies entails purchasing homes directly from sellers and then re-listing them after doing minor work. For Zillow, one of the first steps in its decision to purchase any home is the ""Zestimate"" — a machine-learning-assisted estimate of a home's market value that is calculated by taking into account oodles of data about the property gathered from sources including tax and property records, homeowner-submitted details such as the addition of a bathroom or bedroom, and pictures of the house. Rival platforms such as Redfin have their own estimates that take similar data into account.

""The Zestimate, facts you provided, and comparable homes nearby are used to calculate an estimated sale price,"" Zillow explained on its Zillow Offers webpage to homeowners who may be interested in selling their property to the company. (The page now notes the company is ""winding down"" the service, and isn't making new offers on homes.) After that estimate, the page explained, Zillow conducts an in-person evaluation of a property, determines the amount it deems necessary for repairs before it could resell the house, and then makes a final offer. Zillow has bought tens of thousands of homes since the launch of Zillow Offers, but has sold many fewer than it snapped up: according to its quarterly results, it purchased 27,000 homes from April 2018 through September 2021, and sold nearly 17,000.

Zillow declined a request for an interview with Krishna Rao, the company's vice president of analytics. In a statement, Zillow spokesperson Viet Shelton told CNN Business the company used the Zestimate for Zillow Offers ""the same way we encourage the public to use it: as a starting point.""

""The challenge we faced in Zillow Offers was the ability to accurately forecast the future price of inventory three to six months out, in a market where there were larger and more rapid changes in home values than ever before,"" Shelton said.

Indeed, since Zillow entered the home-flipping business in 2018, real estate markets have changed in wildly unpredictable ways. The pandemic led to a temporary housing market freeze, followed by a supply and demand imbalance that caused an unprecedented rise in home prices. This may only have complicated the company's decision to include the Zestimate — which Zillow points out is not an appraisal, but a ""computer-generated estimate of the value of the home today, given the available data"" — as part of the Zillow Offers process in more than 20 cities.

Artificial intelligence can look at far more information, far more quickly, than a single human could when considering a fair price for a home, weighing factors like comparable home sales in an area, how many people are looking in a specific neighborhood and so on. Still, ""you can have a real estate agent look at a house and in one second pick out one critical factor of the valuation that just doesn't exist as ones and zeroes in any database,"" said Mike DelPrete, a real estate technology strategist and scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado Boulder.

A key part of Zillow

The Zestimate has been a key part of Zillow's brand since the company first launched its website in 2006. The term is featured prominently on millions of Zillow's home listings; it's trademarked by the company; and it's mentioned 61 times in its IPO paperwork from 2011.

""Three times a week, we create more than 500,000 unique valuation models, built atop 3.2 terabytes of data, to generate current Zestimates on more than 70 million US homes,"" the company wrote in a securities filing in 2011. More than 10 years later, the company publishes Zestimates for more than 100 million US homes.

If you're looking up homes on Zillow's website or app, the Zestimate is featured prominently in each listing, whether the home is for sale or not. If the house is currently for sale, a red dot is shown next to the words ""House for sale,"" and the Zestimate, if it's available for that home, will appear on the same line.

Though the company points out that the Zestimate is not a home appraisal, the feature's accuracy has been called into question over the years. For example, it became the subject of a lawsuit brought by homeowners in 2017. (That suit was dismissed.)

Zillow has spent years improving the Zestimate, going so far as to run a multi-year data science competition to improve the accuracy of the algorithm behind it. The company awarded a three-person team the $1 million prize in early 2019.

The Zestimate currently has a median error rate of 1.9% for homes that are on the market, Shelton said, meaning Zillow's estimates for half the homes on the market come within 1.9% of the actual selling price. That percentage of error is much higher -- 6.9%, according to Shelton -- for off-market homes. Being off by as little as 1.9% on a property with a Zestimate of $500,000 is still nearly $10,000; that figure multiplies over many, many homes in different cities across the United States.

An art, not just a science

It's one thing to build a model on a website that's often reasonably accurate. It's another to then try to use that model in the real world to make very costly bets — and do so at scale, according to Nima Shahbazi, a member of the team that won the Zestimate algorithm competition and CEO of Mindle.AI, which helps companies use AI to make predictions. For instance, if any homes Zillow purchased had hidden problems — such as a missed crack in the foundation — the Zestimate would not be able to predict those issues, he said.

""There are many different parts between a very decent model and deploying the model into production that can go wrong,"" he said.

Zillow was using the Zestimate to help it make purchasing decisions for homes it hoped to make a profit off of over time. But Nikhil Malik, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Southern California, said algorithms tend to be good at making fine-grained, short-term predictions, such as for predicting stock prices a second in advance. But there simply isn't enough data for an algorithm to learn about longer busts and booms, according to Malik, who researches algorithmic pricing and has studied the Zestimate in particular.

There are also many unquantifiable aspects of putting a price tag on a home, DelPrete noted, such as the value of living in the same neighborhood you grew up in or down the street from your parents. These can vary from person to person, which makes it even harder to outsource a home valuation process to a computer.

""It's a good tool for what it is,"" DelPrete said of the Zestimate, but it's a mistake to think it can be used to accurately predict house prices now or in the future. He sees it as ""almost a toy,"" meant more for piquing your curiosity when looking up your home or your neighbor's home online.

""If you want to do iBuying and you're going to make thousands of offers every day you have to be really good at valuing homes, not only today but three to six months in the future,"" he said. ""And that's an art and a science.""",Global,2021.11.02,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/149,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction

False advertising harms consumers and is damaging to a fair marketplace. It is also illegal.

The Federal Trade Commission Act is the primary statute of the [Federal Trade] Commission. Under this Act … the Commission is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; (c) prescribe rules defining with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive, and establishing requirements designed to prevent such acts or practices; (d) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce… [1],[2]

Under the Federal Trade Commission Act:

Advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.

Advertisers must have evidence to back up their claims; and

Advertisements cannot be unfair.

In addition to false advertising being a violation of Federal law, all 50 states have legislation aimed at protecting consumers in their state from deceptive practices. 19 states have adopted the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act[3] while the remaining states have their own, similar laws. The consumer protection laws in 49 states explicitly forbid false advertising.[4]

What is Web Accessibility?

Web Accessibility, in simplest terms, is the extent to which people with disabilities can access websites and other web-based systems such as online retail and banking, web-based software necessary for their jobs, social media, and more. While people with disabilities may require additional hardware or software (called Assistive Technologies) to facilitate that access, websites still must be designed and programmed properly so that the assistive technologies can accurately interpret and/ or facilitate the proper experience for the users.

The criteria against which accessibility is typically measured is a standard known as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The WCAG standard is developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group of the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), the international standards body of the Web. This working group currently has 182 participants, including 32 invited experts, representing 57 organizations across the globe. Version 2.0 of WCAG is recognized as an ISO standard (ISO/ IEC 40500:2012). It is the basis for, or referenced by, 39 laws and policies around the globe. In the United States, it is incorporated by reference in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and is often referenced in lawsuit filings, settlements, and consent decrees for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

False advertising among Web Accessibility Overlay vendors

History and description of Overlays

The first tools for testing a website's accessibility were created not long after foundational work for the first version of WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) - the predominant industry standard defining the requirements for accessibility on the Web - was created. Shortly after the final release of WCAG 1.0, products purporting to deliver automated compliance were created. It did not take long before companies that were promoting automated compliance were being heavily criticized among those in the accessibility field as being misguided and for overstating their utility for people with disabilities[5].

Those early products almost always came in the form of small user interface controls that merely read the page's content aloud. Over time, similarly-positioned products would move to adding ""widgets"" which intend to function as on-page assistive technologies by adding controls to modify the features of the websites on which they were deployed. These controls do things like increase font size, change the contrast of the colors on the page, and change the appearance of certain types of content on the page.

Figure 1: Screenshot of the ""widget"" from UserWay. Nearly all overlays have their own version of this type of control set which offer so-called ""enhancements"" that change the display of the site upon which they are installed. Screenshot taken November 11, 2021

More recently, vendors of these products claim that their product can repair underlying code quality problems in the sites on which they're deployed and, further still, claim that they are using artificial intelligence to render websites compliant with laws and standards having to do with accessibility.

These claims are poorly received by career professionals in the accessibility field. Over 600 people have endorsed a community-driven statement against overlay products called the Overlay Factsheet.[6] The list of signatories on the factsheet includes accessibility experts, disability rights advocates, lawyers, contributors & editors for the technical specifications that run the Web itself, and most importantly, end users with disabilities. The list of signatories come from over 16 countries around the world. In summary, the Overlay Factsheet's signers agree that:

Overlay widgets are unnecessary and are poorly placed in the technology stack.

While some automated repair is possible, customers should be discouraged from using an overlay as a long-term solution.

While the use of an overlay may improve compliance with a handful of provisions in major accessibility standards, full compliance cannot be achieved with an overlay.

Adding an overlay to your site may run counter to end users' preference for privacy and may create risk of noncompliance with applicable [privacy] regulations.

No overlay product on the market can cause a website to become fully compliant with any existing accessibility standard and therefore cannot eliminate legal risk.

Despite the above, deceptive marketing is almost universal among overlay vendors.

Below, we provide specific examples of false claims made by Overlay vendors. [7] In summary, the false claims made by overlay vendors fit into one of the following themes:

Adding the overlay product is the only thing the customer needs to do for accessibility.

By using the overlay product, the customer's site will automatically become compliant with the ADA (and other relevant regulations and standards).

By using the overlay product, the customer's site will automatically attain compliance in an extremely short period of time.

By using the overlay product, the customer's website will automatically be accessible to everyone.

By using the overlay product, the customer will automatically be shielded from litigation.

The overlay product is the only one on the market that can make the customer's site compliant.

The overlay product alone is sufficient in achieving compliance without any other work needed on the underlying code.

In addition to the above, many of the overlay vendors also claim the following which are highly dubious at best, and outright lies at worst:

Improved usability.

Increased rates of converting website visitors to purchasers.

Exaggerated number of customers.

Claiming name-brand customers who are not actually customers.

Collaboration with 3rd parties with whom they have not collaborated with.

The product is a sufficient alternative to specialized assistive technologies

Specific examples of false claims made by Overlay vendors

This section contains one example for each of the types of false claims made by overlay vendors. For the full list of gathered evidence and associated data, please see this document's appendixes.

Claim: Adding the product is the only thing the customer needs to do for accessibility

The most factually incorrect claim made by overlay vendors is that adding the product to their website is the only thing the customer needs to do for accessibility.

The Truth

In fact, no overlay product on the market can make a website fully accessible, much less conformant to major industry standards. While some overlay products can perform some behind-the-scenes repair of accessibility issues, the extent of those fixes are exceedingly small. Additionally, the ""widgets"" provided by overlays are most often a poorly executed attempt at replicating capabilities that already exist in the features of the user's browser and/ or operating system settings.

Example

The image below shows the EqualWeb product's font-size increasing feature. The EqualWeb product only provides an increase of up to 150% while users of both Windows and macOS operating systems can increase system font sizes several times higher and offer additional capabilities to zoom the entire screen many times over.

Figure 2: Screenshot of the EqualWeb product after triggering the largest font size increase the product offers. In this case it has increased the font size of text from 18px to 24px.

This does not prevent overlay vendors from making the claim - explicitly or implicitly - that adding their product to your site is the only thing you need to do. In the example below, Allyable says ""… we already did all the work for you!"" suggesting the site's owner doesn't need to do anything else to make their website accessible once Allyable is installed on the site.

Figure 3: Screenshot from Twitter status posted by Allyable stating: ""Need to make your digital assets accessible? No worries - we already did all the work for you!"". Screenshot taken October 21, 2021

Claim: By using the product, the customer's site will become compliant with the ADA and other relevant regulations and standards.

Overlay vendors frequently cite the specific regulations and standards against which the customer's site will become compliant once installing the product. This list includes the ADA, WCAG, and international regulations such as EN 301 549.

The Truth

Because these products are incapable of repairing all accessibility issues on a website, it stands to reason that they are also incapable of delivering compliance with standards and regulations. Doing so with automated means is completely impossible for many reasons, such as:

There are no specific technical requirements for ADA Title III. While ADA-related lawsuits and settlements tend to agree on WCAG 2.1 Level AA, this is not codified by the law itself.

Section 508 and EAA/ EN 301 549 contain several items called ""Functional Performance Criteria[8]"". These criteria are typically very subjective, not clearly defined in a way that can be easily tested by machines, and heavily dependent on context.

Some of the Success Criterion in WCAG relate to things that change on the page during user-triggered actions that cannot be detected by an overlay reliably enough to predict what action it should take to ensure compliance.

Example

In the example below, Accessus.ai claims it is ""the only automatic solution"" and that it can bring sites into compliance with WCAG 2.1, ADA Title III, Section 508, EAA/EN 301 549[9].

Figure 4: Screenshot from Accessus.ai website claiming it will bring a site into compliance with WCAG 2.1, ADA, Section 508 and more. Screenshot taken November 5, 2021

Claim: By using the product, the customer's site will attain compliance in an extremely short period of time.

Overlay vendors' marketing messaging preys upon the often-urgent nature of potential customers' needs and/ or the concern that making a website accessible will be difficult and take a long time. The overlay vendors' messaging often contain such claims as:

""Up to 48 hours from installation"" - Accessus.ai

""In up to 48 hours, your website is accessible and compliant"" - AccessiBe

""Compliant with ADA & WCAG Laws on Day 1 of implementation"" - AudioEye

The Truth

As has already been established, these products cannot cause a website to become compliant on their own in any period, much less the extraordinarily short period of time they state in their marketing claims. Effectively making an existing website compliant with WCAG can take several weeks to several months depending on the nature and size of the website and the number, nature, and severity of accessibility issues.

Example

The screenshot below, from UserWay, claims ""UserWay's solutions provide full WCAG & ADA compliance from day one, and every single day thereafter"".

Figure 5: Screenshot from UserWay's website claiming ""Full WCAG & ADA compliance from day one"". Screenshot taken October 20, 2021

Claim: By using the product, the customer's website will be accessible to everyone.

A frequent theme among overlay vendors isn't just that the customer's website will become compliant with major industry standards but that the site will become accessible to everyone.

The Truth

Unfortunately, ""accessible to everyone"" is not possible:

Some cognitive disabilities are difficult or impossible to design/ develop for.

Some accessibility changes may benefit one population while decreasing usability for others.

This is why assistive technologies exist. When deployed on the user's computer, either as hardware, software, or an alternate device altogether, the user with disabilities can choose the necessary assistive technology to assist with their specific needs.

Figure 6: Alternative communication devices on display at an exhibitor's table at the annual CSUN Conference on Disabilities

Due to the extreme levels of variance in the nature, causes, and severity of disabilities - and the possibility of a person having multiple disabilities - no overlay on the market can provide a complete solution and none have ever proven to come close.

Example

The below tweet from EqualWeb states ""EqualWeb offers a 100% ADA WCAG 2.1 AA compliant solution that will make your website accessible by all"".

Figure 7: EqualWeb claims in this Twitter post that ""EqualWeb offers a 100% ADA WCAG 2.1 AA compliant solution that will make your website accessible by all."" Screenshot taken October 22, 2021

Claim: By using the product, the customer will be shielded from litigation.

Due to the swift pace of litigation around Web Accessibility, customers who have been recently made aware of a lawsuit against them, or customers who are fearful of such a thing, are very receptive to the idea of having a product that can shield them from litigation. Therefore, claiming that they can do so is a very common theme from overlay vendors.

Figure 8: Screenshot of Google Ad from accessiBe which contains the headline ""Is Your Website ADA Compliant? | Avoid Lawsuits with accessiBe"". This ad ran in January 2020

The Truth

Despite the marketing messages of overlay vendors, their claims of legal protection have been proven false. As shown in Appendix A, over 200 companies have been sued in 2021 despite already having purchased an overlay. Of those lawsuits, the accessiBe product was present on 95 of those sites on the day the lawsuit was filed against the defendant.

Example

MaxAccess.io boldly proclaims ""Be Compliant & Avoid Lawsuits. Make Your Website Accessible to Everyone"" and ""Avoid Litigation. Maintain the Highest Level of Compliance 24/7""

Figure 9: Screenshot from MaxAccess.io stating: ""Avoid Litigation. Maintain the Highest Level of Compliance 24/7"". Screenshot taken October 21, 2021

In another example, Shir Ekerling, CEO of accessiBe, proclaims in the LinkedIn comment below that ""You have only seen companies that have joined accessiBe to be a solution to their already existing legal situation"". This claim is demonstrably false because, as shown in Appendix A, 95 companies were sued despite using the accessiBe product on their site.

Figure 10: Screenshot of comment on LinkedIn made by Shir Ekerling, CEO of accessiBe proclaiming ""You have only seen companies that have joined accessiBe to be a solution to their already existing legal situation."" Screenshot taken October 27, 2021

Claim: The product is the only one on the market that can make the customer's site compliant.

Another common theme among overlay vendors is the claim that they are the only vendor whose product can render the customer's site compliant.

The Truth

Beyond the fact that these products don't do what they claim to, the claim that they're the only one who can do so is untrue. While the accessibility industry is quite small, there are several companies with the domain knowledge, tooling, and development capabilities necessary to make customers' sites accessible and compliant fully and completely with WCAG.

Example

On September 30, Allyable Tweeted ""Allyable is the only digital accessibility provider that gives an end-to-end solution… ""

Figure 11: Screenshot from a Twitter post by Allyable claiming ""Allyable is the only digital accessibility provider that gives an end-to-end solution… "". Screenshot taken October 21, 2021

Claim: The product alone is sufficient in achieving compliance without any other work needed on the underlying code

A popular refrain within overlay vendor's marketing is that ""one line of code"" is all that is needed. They claim that by adding one line of (JavaScript) code, which contains the overlay product's code, the site will become accessible. The follow-on claim, as shown below, is that there is nothing else that will need to be changed on the customer's site.

The Truth

This claim would be true if the products did what the vendors claim they do, but that is not the case. In fact, it has been proven[10] that such products are unable to correct accessibility issues in the following types of content:

Images and other non-text-content

Forms

Document heading structure

Keyboard accessibility and programmatic focus management

Example

The below advertisement from UserWay states ""No changes to your website's Code. Fully Automated.""

Figure 12: Screenshot of Google ad placed by UserWay which proclaims, twice, ""No changes to Your Website's Code"". This ad ran September 2021

Claim: Increased conversion rates

""Conversion"" is the point in time where a website's visitor performs a desired action that places them on the path toward becoming a paying customer. Marketers measure conversion rates as a metric that helps determine the effectiveness of their marketing efforts. Some overlay vendors claim that you will increase traffic and/ or increase conversions simply by installing their product.

The Truth

Increasing a website's accessibility is often claimed to be a means to increase conversion, though most discussion on this topic is based on little more than conjecture. Nobody, overlays vendors or anyone else, has ever provided sufficient evidence to prove that accessibility improvements alone will result in increased conversion rates.

Example

In the example provided below, ActiveIntent claims that you will increase conversions by 30% - a number that should be seen as ridiculous, in the strictest sense of the word, because a conversion rate of 30% is 4-7x more than what many marketers understand to be a good conversion rate.[11]

Figure 13: ActiveIntent claims that using their software will increase conversion by 30%. Screenshot taken October 20, 2021

Claim: Exaggerated number of customers

According to Robert Cialdini,[12] Social Proof is one of the most powerful influencers. In e-commerce, the impression that a specific peer of high esteem has purchased your product can help influence a customer to buy.

The Truth

Overlay vendors frequently exaggerate the number of customers they have. By exaggerating this number, overlay vendors make their products seem to be more popular than they really are. In fact, as shown in Appendix F, overlay vendors often overstate their market penetration 3-fold or more.

Example

In the example below, EqualWeb claims to be installed on 100,543,679 web pages. In this case, ""web pages"", as a term, is a bit ambiguous. One can reasonably assume that ""web pages"" is not the same as ""sites"", which would be a collection of pages under a distinct domain. However, according to data gathered for this report, the number of sites that have installed EqualWeb is close to 6000. Even if we assume a rather generous 500 distinct pages per site, EqualWeb is still overstating their claim by over 300%. As shown in Appendix D these claims of market penetration can often be exaggerated significantly.

Figure 14: Screenshot from EqualWeb, claiming that their product is installed on over 100 million web pages. Screenshot taken November 5, 2021

Claim: Specific brands as customers which are not

Like above, when it comes to Social Proof, a list of impressive customers can go a long way toward impressing those who may be similarly inclined to purchase the product.

The Truth

When it comes to overlay vendors, there's often a disconnect between their actual customer list and their claims. They often use names, logos, and testimonials of impressive companies with which they do no actual business. Another tactic used is to add the logo of a multinational corporation on their site, lending the impression that the entire corporation is a customer, when only a small, local subsidiary is the customer.

Example

Allyable has an impressive list of logos on their home page under the heading ""Trusted By"". Among the logos are companies like Diverse Ability Magazine, AudioCodes, Bank Hapoalim, and Microsoft, none of whom are Allyable customers. In fact, 10 out of the 15 companies listed are not Allyable customers, 1 is a reseller, and 3 are customers of a reseller. In other words, only 1 of the companies listed is a direct customer of Allyable.

Figure 15: Screenshot from Allyable.com claiming to have several customers that they don't have. Screenshot taken October 26, 2021

Claim: That the overlay widget is a suitable alternative to assistive technologies

The ""widgets"" that form the bulk of the functionality of overlay products present controls that transform the site's appearance and features in ways that they claim make the site more accessible to end users with disabilities.

The Truth

In nearly all cases, the ""enhancements"" facilitated by overlay products already exist on the user's computer when purchased. In Windows, these features are located under ""Ease of Access"" settings[13], and in macOS they are in ""Accessibility"" within System Preferences[14]. Additionally, many accessibility preferences can be set within the user's browser. Users can also purchase specialized assistive technologies - both hardware and software - for their particular disability and preferences.

The fundamental absurdity of overlay vendors claiming that their product is useful as an assistive technology is that the claim fails to acknowledge that their product is poorly placed in the technology stack:

If a user needs larger text on a website, they need larger text on all sites and applications

If a user needs a high-contrast mode on a website, they need it on all sites and applications

If a user needs text read aloud on a website, they need it on all sites and applications

The claim that the overlay widgets are useful in overcoming accessibility barriers strategically ignores the fact that users who need those features on a specific site will need those features to start the computer, open their browser, and navigate to the site in the first place.

The last reason that these products are not a suitable alternative to assistive technologies is because they often do not perform as well as the user's built-in assistive technologies.

The font size adjustments often do not increase to the same levels. For example, Allyable, AudioEye, and UserWay only go to 200% while EqualWeb and MaxAccess only go to 150%. Built-in features for Windows and macOS go much larger.

None of the overlay widgets' high contrast modes offer the variety, granularity, or customization capabilities of Windows or macOS

Example

The most egregious example of this type of claim is the one below, from UserWay, who proclaims ""Unlike standard screen readers, UserWay's is engineered specifically for websites. Over 40 languages. Multiple reading speeds. A seamless experience for all.""

These claims are particularly deceptive because:

As already mentioned, if a user needs a screen reader, they will need it to assist them in navigating to a website that has UserWay's product installed.

The different languages that can be supported is dependent upon the speech synthesizer that is on the user's computer.

Depending upon the supported speech synthesizers on a user's computer, JAWS and NVDA (""standard"" screen readers implied by UserWay) can support approximately 80 languages.

UserWay only supports 3 reading speeds (""normal"", ""fast"", and ""slow""), whereas real screenreaders can typically offer specific word-per-minute granularity and some blind screenreader users can listen to their computers at 450 words per minute[15].

Figure 16: Since-deleted Tweet from UserWay, dated November 3, 2021, suggesting that their widget is a suitable alternative to major screen readers

Claim: Collaboration with 3rd parties with whom they have not collaborated with

Another way an overlay vendor can use Social Proof to convince potential customers that their product is respectable is to claim that they've collaborated with others in the industry to drive innovation in their product.

The Truth

While there may be cases where overlay vendors are in contact with the general community of users, in many cases the accessibility field shuns overlay vendors. In June 2020, for instance, the National Federation for the Blind (NFB) went so far as to say, ""… the Board [of NFB] believes that accessiBe currently engages in behavior that is harmful to the advancement of blind people in society.""[16]

Example

On August 21, 2019, a representative from accessiBe, named Pamela, claimed that accessiBe had collaborated with JAWS developers on the accessiBe product, stating[17]:

For more than 18 months, our Research & Development process focused on working back to back with people with different disabilities, even prior to our first live version. The process also included leading experts in accessibility, as well as a developer from the JAWS team whom, as you may know, is an eminence in screen-reader technology in the world today.

According to blogger and accessibility consultant Adrian Roselli, this claim was false. He received communication from Vispero/ Freedom Scientific, the maker of JAWS, which stated:

""Neither Vispero nor any of its developers have ever worked with accessiBe relative to any products and services."" Roselli also identified two other instances in which accessiBe made this false claim.[18]

Conclusion

Although standards and technologies are available - and have been available - to make websites accessible for over 20 years, we still live in a world in which the majority of websites are designed without accessibility in mind. Consequentially, most websites contain significant challenges for people with disabilities. Thankfully governments understand how important Accessibility is for equitable access to the digital world and, as a result, every major economic region in the world has laws mandating accessibility. In the US we have laws such as the ADA, The Rehabilitation Act, CVAA, and Air Carrier Access Act.

Federal, State, and Local government websites must comply with accessibility requirements. In recent years, lawsuits have resulted in a widespread recognition that most private companies must comply. For those who do not comply and who then receive legal complaints penalties can be painful.

Providing a solution for this problem is a very healthy business model - especially if you can do it quickly, cheaply, and with minimal disruption to the existing User Interface. This is the false promise made by overlay vendors.

The fact remains, however, that technology does not yet exist to cause an already existing website to become fully compliant with existing laws and standards without modifying the design, structure, and features of the site. This usually takes time, money, and disruption to the development process to insert the missing accessibility pieces. Accessibility experts provide consultation on these processes, helping companies establish new development processes such that their digital technologies become accessible each time from the beginning.

Accessibility experts, advocates, and end users with disabilities agree that overlay products are not fit for task of ‘fixing’ inaccessible websites. Nonetheless, vendors of these products continue to traffic in false claims that they possess the technology to make a website accessible and eliminate the risk of a lawsuit due to disability discrimination.

These false claims are insidious:

While the false claims in the diet, fitness, or male enhancement industries prey on the buyer, the false claims of overlay vendors prey on the buyer while also facilitating discrimination against people with disabilities. Based on the evidence provided in this report, overlay vendors are in the practice of convincing their customers that all the customer needs to do is install their product for near-instantaneous, around-the-clock, full compliance with industry accepted accessibility standards and that, as a result, the customer will be protected against an accessibility-related lawsuit. Naturally, this means that the customer will pursue no additional means of ensuring that they are providing an accessible experience on their website. The result is that the customer's website is not made significantly more accessible and that end users with disabilities are still unable to gain full and equal access as required by law. In short, overlay products perpetuate discrimination against persons with disabilities through their false claims and should be held accountable.

There is an industry of accessibility consultants and professionals who are working to help organizations to make more accessible websites through (what is widely considered to be) legitimate means. The costs to organizations to remediate their inaccessible content come in the form of payment for expert assistance; time for conducting a thorough job; and the provision of internal resources to adjust their previously accessibility-deficient development and testing processes.

In early 2020, a bank manager in the Hong Kong received a call from a man whose voice he recognized—a director at a company with whom he’d spoken before. The director had good news: His company was about to make an acquisition, so he needed the bank to authorize some transfers to the tune of $35 million. A lawyer named Martin Zelner had been hired to coordinate the procedures and the bank manager could see in his inbox emails from the director and Zelner, confirming what money needed to move where. The bank manager, believing everything appeared legitimate, began making the transfers.

What he didn’t know was that he’d been duped as part of an elaborate swindle, one in which fraudsters had used “deep voice” technology to clone the director’s speech, according to a court document unearthed by Forbes in which the U.A.E. has sought American investigators’ help in tracing $400,000 of stolen funds that went into U.S.-based accounts held by Centennial Bank. The U.A.E., which is investigating the heist as it affected entities within the country, believes it was an elaborate scheme, involving at least 17 individuals, which sent the pilfered money to bank accounts across the globe.

Little more detail was given in the document, with none of the victims’ names provided. The Dubai Public Prosecution Office, which is leading the investigation, hadn’t responded to requests for comment at the time of publication. Martin Zelner, a U.S.-based lawyer, had also been contacted for comment, but had not responded at the time of publication.

It’s only the second known case of fraudsters allegedly using voice-shaping tools to carry out a heist, but appears to have been far more successful than the first, in which fraudsters used the tech to impersonate a CEO of a U.K.-based energy firm in an attempt to steal $240,000 in 2019, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The U.A.E. case shows how devastating such high-tech swindles can be and lands amidst warnings about the use of AI to create so-called deep fake images and voices in cybercrime.

“Audio and visual deep fakes represent the fascinating development of 21st century technology yet they are also potentially incredibly dangerous posing a huge threat to data, money and businesses,” says Jake Moore, a former police officer with the Dorset Police Department in the U.K. and now a cybersecurity expert at security company ESET. “We are currently on the cusp of malicious actors shifting expertise and resources into using the latest technology to manipulate people who are innocently unaware of the realms of deep fake technology and even their existence.

“Manipulating audio, which is easier to orchestrate than making deep fake videos, is only going to increase in volume and without the education and awareness of this new type of attack vector, along with better authentication methods, more businesses are likely to fall victim to very convincing conversations.”

Once a technology confined to the realm of fictional capers like Mission: Impossible, voice cloning is now widely available. Various tech startups are working on increasingly sophisticated AI voice technologies, from London’s Aflorithmic to Ukraine’s Respeecher and Canada’s Resemble.AI. The technology caused a stir in recent months with the revelation that the late Anthony Bourdain had his voice synthesized for a documentary on his life. Meanwhile, recognizing the potential for malicious use of the AI, a handful of companies, such as $900 million-valued security firm Pindrop, now claim they can detect synthesized voices and thereby prevent frauds.

If recordings of you speaking are available online, whether on social media, YouTube or on an employer’s website, there may well be a secret battle going on for control of your voice without you knowing.

UPDATE: After publication, the U.A.E. Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Cooperation contacted Forbes to note that the affected bank was in Hong Kong, not within the U.A.E., though the Dubai investigators were leading the probe. The article was updated on October 22 2022 to reflect that.

In a statement, HE Hamid Al Zaabi, director general of the U.A.E. Executive Office of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing, added: “Even with incidents happening outside the U.A.E., we will work closely with law enforcement partners around the world to identify and detect those individuals who knowingly engage in deceptive practices such as imposter fraud. The U.A.E. will then pursue to the fullest extent of the law these individuals, ensuring they are held accountable and brought to justice quickly.”","Hong Kong, China",2020.01.01,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/147,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other experts: The paper’s focus on natural language processing is ultimately interesting and worthwhile. Its ethical component, he said, “makes it societally fraught in a way that means we have to be way more careful with it in my opinion.
",Negative,uncertain,"We’ve all been in situations where we had to make tough ethical decisions. Why not dodge that pesky responsibility by outsourcing the choice to a machine learning algorithm?

That’s the idea behind Ask Delphi, a machine-learning model from the Allen Institute for AI. You type in a situation (like “donating to charity”) or a question (“is it okay to cheat on my spouse?”), click “Ponder,” and in a few seconds Delphi will give you, well, ethical guidance.

The project launched last week, and has subsequently gone viral online for seemingly all the wrong reasons. Much of the advice and judgements it’s given have been… fraught, to say the least.

For example, when a user asked Delphi what it thought about “a white man walking towards you at night,” it responded “It’s okay.”

But when they asked what the AI thought about “a black man walking towards you at night” its answer was clearly racist.

The issues were especially glaring in the beginning of its launch.

For instance, Ask Delphi initially included a tool that allowed users to compare whether situations were more or less morally acceptable than another — resulting in some really awful, bigoted judgments.

Besides, after playing around with Delphi for a while, you’ll eventually find that it’s easy to game the AI to get pretty much whatever ethical judgement you want by fiddling around with the phrasing until it gives you the answer you want.

So yeah. It’s actually completely fine to crank “Twerkulator” at 3am even if your roommate has an early shift tomorrow — as long as it makes you happy.

It also spits out some judgments that are complete head scratchers. Here’s one that we did where Delphi seems to condone war crimes.

Geneva Conventions? Never heard of her.

Machine learning systems are notorious for demonstrating unintended bias. And as is often the case, part of the reason Delphi’s answers can get questionable can likely be linked back to how it was created.

The folks behind the project drew on some eyebrow-raising sources to help train the AI, including the “Am I the Asshole?” subreddit, the “Confessions” subreddit, and the “Dear Abby” advice column, according to the paper the team behind Delphi published about the experiment.

It should be noted, though, that just the situations were culled from those sources — not the actual replies and answers themselves. For example, a scenario such as “chewing gum on the bus” might have been taken from a Dear Abby column. But the team behind Delphi used Amazon’s crowdsourcing service MechanicalTurk to find respondents to actually train the AI.

While it might just seem like another oddball online project, some experts believe that it might actually be causing more harm than good.

After all, the ostensible goal of Delphi and bots like it is to create an AI sophisticated enough to make ethical judgements, and potentially turn them into moral authorities. Making a computer an arbiter of moral judgement is uncomfortable enough on its own, but even its current less-refined state can have some harmful effects.

“The authors did a lot of cataloging of possible biases in the paper, which is commendable, but once it was released, people on Twitter were very quick to find judgments that the algorithm made that seem quite morally abhorrent,” Dr. Brett Karlan, a postdoctoral fellow researching cognitive science and AI at the University of Pittsburgh (and friend of this reporter), told Futurism. “When you’re not just dealing with understanding words, but you’re putting it in moral language, it’s much more risky, since people might take what you say as coming from some sort of authority.”

Karlan believes that the paper’s focus on natural language processing is ultimately interesting and worthwhile. Its ethical component, he said, “makes it societally fraught in a way that means we have to be way more careful with it in my opinion.”

Though the Delphi website does include a disclaimer saying that it’s currently in its beta phase and shouldn’t be used “for advice, or to aid in social understanding of humans,” the reality is that many users won’t understand the context behind the project, especially if they just stumbled onto it.

“Even if you put all of these disclaimers on it, people are going to see ‘Delphi says X’ and, not being literate in AI, think that statement has moral authority to it,” Karlan said.

And, at the end of the day, it doesn’t. It’s just an experiment — and the creators behind Delphi want you to know that.

“It is important to understand that Delphi is not built to give people advice,” Liwei Jiang, PhD student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and co-author of the study, told Futurism. “It is a research prototype meant to investigate the broader scientific questions of how AI systems can be made to understand social norms and ethics.”

Jiang added the goal with the current beta version of Delphi is actually to showcase the reasoning differences between humans and bots. The team wants to “highlight the wide gap between the moral reasoning capabilities of machines and humans,” Jiang added, “and to explore the promises and limitations of machine ethics and norms at the current stage.”

Perhaps one of the most uncomfortable aspects about Delphi and bots like it is the fact that it’s ultimately a reflection of our own ethics and morals, with Jiang adding that “it is somewhat prone to the biases of our time.” One of the latest disclaimers added to the website even says that the AI simply guesses what an average American might think of a given situation.

After all, the model didn’t learn its judgments on its own out of nowhere. It came from people online, who sometimes do believe abhorrent things. But when this dark mirror is held up to our faces, we jump away because we don’t like what’s reflected back.",Global,2021.10.20,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/146,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd spent my morning so far in the backseat of the Model 3 using ""full self-driving,"" the system that Tesla says will change the world by enabling safe and reliable autonomous vehicles. I'd watched the software nearly crash into a construction site, try to turn into a stopped truck and attempt to drive down the wrong side of the road. Angry drivers blared their horns as the system hesitated, sometimes right in the middle of an intersection. (We had an attentive human driver behind the wheel during all of our tests, to take full control when needed.)

The Model 3's ""full self-driving"" needed plenty of human interventions to protect us and everyone else on the road. Sometimes that meant tapping the brake to turn off the software, so that it wouldn't try to drive around a car in front of us. Other times we quickly jerked the wheel to avoid a crash. (Tesla tells drivers to pay constant attention to the road, and be prepared to act immediately.)

I hoped the car wouldn't make any more stupid mistakes. After what felt like an eternity the kids finished crossing. I exhaled.

We were clear to make our turn. The car seemed overly hesitant initially, but then I noticed a bicyclist coming from our left. We waited.

Once the bicyclist crossed the intersection, the car pulled up and made a smooth turn.

Over the past year I've watched more than a hundred videos of Tesla owners using ""full self-driving"" technology, and I've spoken to many of them about their experiences.

""Full self-driving"" is a $10,000 driver-assist feature offered by Tesla. While all new Teslas are capable of using the ""full self-driving"" software, buyers must opt into the costly addition if they want to access the feature. The software is still in Beta and is currently available to only a select group of Tesla owners, though CEO Elon Musk has claimed that a wider rollout is imminent. Musk promises ""full self-driving"" will be totally capable of getting a car to its destination in the near future.

But it doesn't do that. Far from it.

Tesla owners have described the technology as impressive but also flawed. One moment it's driving perfectly, the next moment it nearly crashes into something.

Jason Tallman, a Tesla owner who documents his ""full self-driving"" trips on YouTube, offered to let me experience it first-hand.

We asked Jason to meet us on Brooklyn's Flatbush Avenue. It's an urban artery that funnels thousands of cars, trucks, cyclists and pedestrians into Manhattan. For even experienced human drivers, it can be a challenge.

City driving is chaotic, with vehicles running red lights and pedestrians on nearly every block. It's a far cry from the suburban neighborhoods and predictable highways around Tesla's California offices, or the broad streets of Arizona, where Alphabet's Waymo operates fully autonomous vehicles.

Cruise, GM's self-driving company, recently completed its first fully autonomous rides in San Francisco. But they were conducted after 11 p.m. at night, when traffic is light and few pedestrians or cyclists are present.

Brooklyn offered us a chance to see how close Tesla's autonomous driving software was to replacing human drivers. It's the sort of place where humans drive because they have to, not the sort of place selected by a corporate headquarters. It's where self-driving cars might have the biggest impact.

At one point we were cruising along in the right lane of Flatbush. A construction site loomed ahead. The car continued full speed ahead toward a row of metal fencing.

I felt deja vu as I recalled a video in which a Tesla owner slammed on the brakes after his car appeared set on crashing headlong into a construction site.

But this time I was sitting in the back seat. I instinctively threw up my right arm like the Heisman Trophy, as if to protect myself in a collision.

That was a moment I wished ""full self-driving"" would be quick to change lanes. In other cases, I wished it would chill out on its aggressive turns.

""Full self-driving"" sometimes makes jerky turns. The wheel starts to turn, but then shifts back, before again turning in its intended direction. The staggered turns generally don't seem to be a bother on sweeping suburban curves, but in a dense city largely built before cars, it's uncomfortable.

There's also the braking, which can feel random. At one point a car came close to rear ending us following braking that surprised me. Getting honked at was common. I never quite felt like I knew what ""full self-driving"" would do next. Asking ""full self-driving"" to navigate Brooklyn felt like asking a student driver to take on a road test they weren't ready for yet.

What ""full self-driving"" could do well was impressive, but the experience was ultimately unnerving. I can't imagine using ""full self-driving"" regularly in a city. I noticed I was reluctant to ever look down at the Model 3's dashboard, such as for checking our speed, because I didn't want to take my eyes off the road.

Tesla owners routinely tell me how Autopilot, the highway-focused predecessor to ""full self-driving"" makes their trips less stressful. They arrive at destinations feeling less fatigued. Some have told me they're more likely to go on long road trips because of Autopilot.

But ""full self-driving"" felt like the inverse. I felt like I needed to be constantly on guard to prevent the car from doing something wrong.

Ultimately, seeing ""full self-driving"" in Brooklyn reminded me of the importance of the finer points of driving, which is tough for an artificial intelligence powered car to master. Things like pulling slightly into the intersection on a narrow road to make a left turn, so traffic behind you has room to pull around.

Popular chess YouTuber Antonio Radic had his channel blocked last summer for 'harmful and dangerous' content. He believes the platform's AI mistakenly flagged him for discussing 'black versus white' in a chess conversation

With more than a million subscribers, Agadmator is considered the most popular chess vertical on YouTube.

But on June 28, Radic's channel was blocked after he posted a segment with Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, a five-time champion and the youngest American to earn the title of Grandmaster.

YouTube didn't provide him with a reason for blocking the channel.

In addition to human moderators, YouTube uses AI algorithms to ferret out prohibited content—but if they're not fed the right examples to provide context, those algorithms can flag benign videos.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon tested two top speech classifiers, AI software that can be trained to detect hate speech. More than 80 percent of the comments the programs flagged lacked any racist language, but they did include chess terms like 'black,' 'white,' 'attack' and 'threat'

Radic's channel was reinstated after 24 hours, leading him to speculate his use of the phrase 'black against white' in the Nakamura was the culprit.

At the time, he was talking about the two opposing sides in a chess game.

Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh, a computer scientist at Carnegie Melon's Language Technologies Institute, suspected Radic was right.

'We don't know what tools YouTube uses, but if they rely on artificial intelligence to detect racist language, this kind of accident can happen,' KhudaBukhsh said.

To test his theory, KhudaBukhsh and fellow researcher Rupak Sarkar ran tests on two cutting-edge speech classifiers, AI software that can be trained to detect hate speech.

Radic's channel was blocked for 24 hours after he posted this video, featuring a conversation with Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura

Using the software on over 680,000 comments taken from five popular YouTube chess channels, they found 82 percent of the comments flagged in a sample set didn't include any obvious racist language or hate speech.

Words such as 'black,' 'white,' 'attack' and 'threat' seemed to have set off the filters, KhudaBukhsh and Sarkar said in a presentation this month at the annual Association for the Advancement of AI conference.

The software's accuracy depends on the examples its given, KhudaBukhsh said, and the training data sets for YouTube's classifiers 'likely include few examples of chess talk, leading to misclassification.'

Radić, 33, started his YouTube channel in 2017 and has more than a millions subscribers. His most popular video, a review of a 1962 match, has garnered more than 5.5 million views

If someone as well-known as Radic is being erroneously blocked, he added, 'it may well be happening quietly to lots of other people who are not so well known.'

YouTube declined to indicate what caused Radic's video to be flagged, but told Mail Online, 'When it’s brought to our attention that a video has been removed mistakenly, we act quickly to reinstate it.'

'We also offer uploaders the ability to appeal removals and will re-review the content,' a representative said. 'Agadmator appealed the removal, and we quickly reinstated the video.'

Radić, 33, started his YouTube channel in 2017 and, within a year, its revenue exceeded his day job as a wedding videographer.

'I always loved chess but I live in a small town and there weren't too many people I could talk to about [it],' he told ESPN last year. 'So, starting a YouTube channel kind of made sense.'

His most popular video, a review of a 1962 match between Rashid Nezhmetdinov and Oleg Chernikov, has garnered more than 5.5 million views to date.

COVID lockdowns have sparked a renewed interest in chess: Since March 2020, the server and social network Chess.com has added roughly 2 million new members a month since the pandemic began, Annenberg Media reported.

One of the respondents told BIRN they had reported at least seven accounts for spreading hatred and violent content.

“I do not engage actively on such reports nor do I keep looking and searching them. However, when I do come across one of these hateful, genocide deniers and genocide supporters, it feels the right thing to do, to stop such content from going further,” the respondent said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Maybe one of all the reported individuals stops and asks themselves what led to this and simply opens up discussions, with themselves or their circles.”

Although for those seven acounts Twitter confirmed they violate some of the rules, six of them are still available online.

BIRN methodology BIRN conducted its questionnaire via the network’s tool for engaging citizens in reporting, developed in cooperation with the British Council. The anonymous questionnaire had the aim of collecting information on what type of violations people reported, who was the target and how successful the report was. The questions were available in English, Macedonian, Albanian and Bosnian/Serbian/Montenegrin. BIRN focused on Facebook and Twitter given their popularity in the Balkans and the sensitivity of shared content, which is mostly textual and harder to assess compared to videos and photos.

Another issue that emerged is unclear criteria while reporting violations. Basic knowledge of English is also required.

Sanjana Hattotuwa, special advisor at ICT4Peace Foundation agreed that the in-app or web-based reporting process is confusing.

“Moreover, it is often in English even though the rest of the UI/UX [User Interface/User Experience] could be in the local language. Furthermore, the laborious selection of categories is, for a victim, not easy – especially under duress.”

Facebook told BIRN that the vast majority of reports are reviewed within 24 hours and that the company uses community reporting, human review and automation.

It refused, however, to give any specifics on those it employs to review content or reports in Balkan languages, saying “it isn’t accurate to only give the number of content reviewers”.

“That alone doesn’t reflect the number of people working on a content review for a particular country at any given time,” the spokesperson said.

Social networks often remove content themselves, in what they call a ‘proactive approach’.

According to data provided by Facebook, in the last quarter of 2017 their proactive detection rate was 23.6 per cent.

“This means that of the hate speech we removed, 23.6 per cent of it was found before a user reported it to us,” the spokesperson said. “The remaining majority of it was removed after a user reported it. Today we proactively detect about 95 per cent of hate speech content we remove.”

“Whether content is proactively detected or reported by users, we often use AI to take action on the straightforward cases and prioritise the more nuanced cases, where context needs to be considered, for our reviewers.”

There is no available data, however, when it comes to content in a specific language or country.

Facebook publishes a Community Standards Enforcement Report on a quarterly basis, but, according to the spokesperson, the company does not “disclose data regarding content moderation in specific countries.”

Whatever the tools, the results are sometimes highly questionable.

In May 2018, Facebook blocked for 24 hours the profile of Bosnian journalist Dragan Bursac after he posted a photo of a detention camp for Bosniaks in Serbia during the collapse of federal Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

Facebook determined that Bursac’s post had violated “community standards,” local media reported.

Bojan Kordalov, Skopje-based public relations and new media specialist, said that, “when evaluating efficiency in this area, it is important to emphasise that the traffic in the Internet space is very dense and is increasing every second, which unequivocally makes it a field where everyone needs to contribute”.

“This means that social media managements are undeniably responsible for meeting the standards and compliance with regulations within their platforms, but this does not absolve legislators, governments and institutions of responsibility in adapting to the needs of the new digital age, nor does it give anyone the right to redefine and narrow down the notion and the benefits that democracy brings.”

Lack of language sensibility

SHARE Foundation, a Belgrade-based NGO working on digital rights, said the question was crucial given the huge volume of content flowing through the likes of Facebook and Twitter in all languages.

“When it comes to relatively small language groups in absolute numbers of users, such as languages in the former Yugoslavia or even in the Balkans, there is simply no incentive or sufficient pressure from the public and political leaders to invest in human moderation,” SHARE told BIRN.

Berthelemy of EDRi said the Balkans were not a stand alone example, and that the content moderation practices and policies of Facebook and Twitter are “doomed to fail.”

“Many of these corporations operate on a massive scale, some of them serving up to a quarter of the world’s population with a single service,” Berthelemy told BIRN. “It is impossible for such monolithic architecture, and speech regulation process and policy to accommodate and satisfy the specific cultural and social needs of individuals and groups.”

The European Parliament has also stressed the importance of a combined assessment.

“The expressions of hatred can be conveyed in many ways, and the same words typically used to convey such expressions can also be used for different purposes,” according to a 2020 study – ‘The impact of algorithms for online content filtering or moderation’ – commissioned by the Parliament’s Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs.

“For instance, such words can be used for condemning violence, injustice or discrimination against the targeted groups, or just for describing their social circumstances. Thus, to identify hateful content in textual messages, an attempt must be made at grasping the meaning of such messages, using the resources provided by natural language processing.”

Hattotuwa said that, in general, “non-English language markets with non-Romanic (i.e. not English letter based) scripts are that much harder to design AI/ML solutions around”.

“And in many cases, these markets are out of sight and out of mind, unless the violence, abuse or platform harms are so significant they hit the New York Times front-page,” Hattotuwa told BIRN.

“Humans are necessary for evaluations, but as you know, there are serious emotional / PTSD issues related to the oversight of violent content, that companies like Facebook have been sued for (and lost, having to pay damages).”

Failing in non-English

Dragan Vujanovic of the Sarajevo-based NGO Vasa prava [Your Rights] criticised what he said was a “certain level of tolerance with regards to violations which support certain social narratives.”

“This is particularly evident in the inconsistent behavior of social media moderators where accounts with fairly innocuous comments are banned or suspended while other accounts, with overt abuse and clear negative social impact, are tolerated.”

For Chloe Berthelemy, trying to apply a uniform set of rules on the very diverse range of norms, values and opinions on all available topics that exist in the world is “meant to fail.”

“For instance, where nudity is considered to be sensitive in the United States, other cultures take a more liberal approach,” she said.

The example of Myanmar, when Facebook effectively blocked an entire language by refusing all messages written in Jinghpaw, a language spoken by Myanmar’s ethnic Kachin and written with a Roman alphabet, shows the scale of the issue.

“The platform performs very poorly at detecting hate speech in non-English languages,” Berthelemy told BIRN.

The techniques used to filter content differ depending on the media analysed, according to the 2020 study for the European Parliament.

“A filter can work at different levels of complexity, spanning from simply comparing contents against a blacklist, to more sophisticated techniques employing complex AI techniques,” it said.

“In machine learning approaches, the system, rather than being provided with a logical definition of the criteria to be used to find and classify content (e.g., to determine what counts as hate speech, defamation, etc.) is provided with a vast set of data, from which it must learn on its own the criteria for making such a classification.”

Users of both Twitter and Facebook can appeal in the event their accounts are suspended or blocked.

“Unfortunately, the process lacks transparency, as the number of filed appeals is not mentioned in the transparency report, nor is the number of processed or reinstated accounts or tweets,” the study noted.

Between January and October 2020, Facebook restored some 50,000 items of content without an appeal and 613,000 after appeal.

According to the Twitter Transparency report, in the first six months of 2020, 12.4 million accounts were reported to the company, just over six million of which were reported for hateful conduct and some 5.1 million for “abuse/harassment”.

In the same period, Twitter suspended 925,744 accounts, of which 127,954 were flagged for hateful conduct and 72,139 for abuse/harassment. The company removed such content in a little over 1.9 million cases: 955,212 in the hateful conduct category and 609,253 in the abuse/harassment category.

Toskic Cvetinovic said the rules needed to be clearer and better communicated to users by “living people.”

“Often, the content removal doesn’t have a corrective function, but amounts to censorship,” she said.

Berthelemy said that, “because the dominant social media platforms reproduce the social systems of oppression, they are also often unsafe for many groups at the margins.”

“They are unable to understand the discriminatory and violent online behaviours, including certain forms of harassment and violent threats and therefore, cannot address the needs of victims,” Berthelemy told BIRN.

“Furthermore,” she said, “those social media networks are also advertisement companies. They rely on inflammatory content to generate profiling data and thus advertisement profits. There will be no effective, systematic response without addressing the business models of accumulating and trading personal data.”...",Gobal,2021.02.16,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/143,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The product in question was a gray zip-up hoodie ($39.95) with the message: “I am immunocompromised — Please give me space.” The “immunocompromised” was in a white rectangle, kind of like Supreme’s red one. It has rave customer reviews on the company’s website

Facebook — or rather, Facebook’s automated advertising center — did not like the ad quite so much.

It was rejected for violating policy — specifically, the promotion of “medical and health care products and services including medical devices,” though it included no such products. Mighty Well appealed the decision, and after some delay, the ruling changed.

This may not seem like such a big deal. After all, the story ended well.

But Mighty Well’s experience is simply one example of a pattern that has been going on for at least two years: The algorithms that are the gatekeepers to the commercial side of Facebook (as well as Instagram, which is owned by Facebook) routinely misidentify adaptive fashion products and block them from their platforms.

At least six other small adaptive clothing companies have experienced the same problems as Mighty Well, which was founded four years ago by Emily Levy and Maria Del Mar Gomez — some to an even greater extent. One brand has been dealing with the issue on a weekly basis; another has had hundreds of products rejected. In each instance, the company has had to appeal each case on an item-by-item basis.

At a time when the importance of representation is at the center of the cultural conversation, when companies everywhere are publicly trumpeting their commitment to “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (D.E.I.) and systemic change, and when a technology company like Facebook is under extra deep scrutiny for the way its policies can shape society at large, the adaptive fashion struggle reflects a bigger issue: the implicit biases embedded in machine learning, and the way they impact marginalized communities.

“It’s the untold story of the consequences of classification in machine learning,” said Kate Crawford, the author of the coming book “Atlas of AI” and the visiting chair in A.I. and justice of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. “Every classification system in machine learning contains a worldview. Every single one.”

And this one, she said, suggests that “the standard human” — one who may be interested in using fashion and style as a form of self-expression — is not automatically recognized as possibly being a disabled human.

“We want to help adaptive fashion brands find and connect with customers on Facebook,” a Facebook spokeswoman emailed when contacted about the issue. “Several of the listings raised to us should not have been flagged by our systems and have now been restored. We apologize for this mistake and are working to improve our systems so that brands don’t run into these issues in the future.”

Facebook is not alone in having A.I.-erected barriers to entry for the adaptive fashion businesses. TikTok and Amazon are among the companies that have had similar issues. But because of Facebook’s 2.8 billion users and because of its stance as the platform that stands for communities, Facebook, which recently took out ads in newspapers, including this one as well as The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, saying they were “standing up” for small businesses, is particularly important to disability groups and the companies that serve them. And Instagram is the fashion world’s platform of choice.

Of Clothes and Context

Adaptive fashion is a relatively new niche of the fashion world, though one that is growing quickly. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 adults in the United States is living with a disability, and Coherent Market Insights has projected that the global adaptive clothing market will be worth more than $392 billion by 2026.

There are now brands that create covers for catheter lines that look like athletic sleeves; colostomy and ostomy bag covers in vivid colors and patterns; underwear that attaches via side closures rather than having to be pulled on over the legs; chic jeans and pants tailored to accommodate the seated body with nonirritating seams; and button-up shirts that employ magnetic closures instead of buttons. These and many other designs were created to focus on the individual, not the diagnosis.

There are some big companies and retailers working in the space, including Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and Aerie, but many of the brands serving the community are small independents, most often started by individuals with personal experience of disability and focused on direct-to-consumer sales. Often they include designers and models with disabilities, who also appear in their advertisements and storefronts.

Maura Horton is one of the pioneers of adaptive clothing. In 2014, she created MagnaReady, a system of magnetic buttons, after her husband learned he had Parkinson’s. In 2019, she sold her company to Global Brands Group, the fashion behemoth that owns Sean John and Frye. Last year Ms. Horton and GBG created JUNIPERunltd, a content hub, e-commerce platform and community focused on the disabled sector, as well as Yarrow, their own proprietary adaptive fashion brand. Ms. Horton planned to advertise on both Facebook and Instagram.

Between November and January, she submitted four series of ads that included a pair of Yarrow trousers, one designed with a “standing fit,” and featuring a woman … well, standing up, and one designed for a person who is seated and featuring a young woman using a wheelchair (the cut changes depending on body positioning). Each time, the standing ad was approved and the wheelchair ad was rejected for not complying with commerce policies that state: “Listings may not promote medical and health care products and services, including medical devices, or smoking cessation products containing nicotine.” In the “seated fit,” the system apparently focused on the wheelchair, not the product being worn by the person in the wheelchair. But even after Ms. Horton successfully appealed the first rejection, the same thing happened again. And again. Each time it took about 10 days for the system to acknowledge it had made a mistake.

“Automation,” Ms. Horton said, “can’t really do D.E.I.”

The problem, Ms. Crawford said, is context. “What does not do context well? Machine learning. Large-scale classification is often simplistic and highly normalized. It is very bad at detecting nuance. So you have this dynamic human context, which is always in flux, coming up against the gigantic wall of hard coded classification.”

Not one of the adaptive fashion companies spoken to for this article believes the platform is purposefully discriminating against people with disabilities. Facebook has been instrumental in creating alt text so that users with impaired vision can access the platform’s imagery. The company has named disability inclusion as “one of our top priorities.” And yet this particular form of discrimination by neglect, first called out publicly in 2018, has apparently not yet risen to the level of human recognition.

Instead, machine learning is playing an ever larger role in perpetuating the problem. According to the Facebook spokeswoman, its automated intelligence doesn’t just control the entry point to the ad and store products. It largely controls the appeal process, too.

The Latest in a History of Misunderstandings

Here’s how it works: A company makes an ad, or creates a shop, and submits it to Facebook for approval, an automated process. (If it’s a storefront, the products can also arrive via a feed, and each one must comply with Facebook rules.) If the system flags a potential violation, the ad or product is sent back to the company as noncompliant. But the precise word or part of the image that created the problem is not identified, meaning it is up to the company to effectively guess where the problem lies.

The company can then either appeal the ad/listing as is, or make a change to the image or wording it hopes will pass the Facebook rules. Either way, the communication is sent back through the automated system, where it may be reviewed by another automated system, or an actual person.

According to Facebook, it has added thousands of reviewers over the last few years, but three million businesses advertise on Facebook, the majority of which are small businesses. The Facebook spokeswoman did not identify what would trigger an appeal being elevated to a human reviewer, or if there was a codified process by which that would happen. Often, the small business owners feel caught in an endless machine-ruled loop.

“The problem we keep coming up against is channels of communication,” said Sinéad Burke, an inclusivity activist who consults with numerous brands and platforms, including Juniper. “Access needs to mean more than just digital access. And we have to understand who is in the room when these systems are created.”

The Facebook spokeswoman said there were employees with disabilities throughout the company, including at the executive level, and that there was an Accessibility team that worked across Facebook to embed accessibility into the product development process. But though there is no question the rules governing ad and store policy created by Facebook were designed in part to protect their communities from false medical claims and fake products, those rules are also, if inadvertently, blocking some of those very same communities from accessing products created for them.

“This is one of the most typical problems we see,” said Tobias Matzner, a professor of media, algorithms and society at Paderborn University in Germany. “Algorithms solve the problem of efficiency at grand scale” — by detecting patterns and making assumptions — “but in doing that one thing, they do all sorts of other things, too, like hurting small businesses.”

Indeed, this is simply the latest in a long history of digital platform problems in reconciling the broad stroke assumptions demanded by code with complex human situations, said Jillian C. York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights. Other examples include Facebook’s past controversies over banning breastfeeding pictures as sexual, and Instagram’s 2015 banning of photos by the poet Rupi Kaur that explored menstruation taboos. Both issues were later corrected after a public outcry. The difference now is that rather than personal content and free speech, the issue has become one of commercial speech.

“We’ve often talked about this in terms of user content, and Facebook has been pushed to take into account cultural differences,” said Tarleton Gillespie, the author of “Custodians of the Internet.” “But clearly the ability to engage in commerce is crucial for a community, and I don’t think they have been pushed as far in that area.”

Make Noise or Give Up

It was on Dec. 3, 2018, when Helya Mohammadian, the founder of Slick Chicks, a company that creates adaptive underwear that is sold by companies like Nordstrom and Zappos, first noticed the problem. Links to its website posted on Facebook and Instagram sent users to an error page and this statement: “The link you tried to visit goes against the Facebook community standards,” a practice known as “shadow banning.”

The images on the site featured brand ambassadors and customers modeling the product, though not in a provocative way. Still, the algorithm appeared to have defaulted to the assumption that it was looking at adult content.

Ms. Mohammadian began appealing the ruling via the customer support service, sending roughly an email a day for three weeks. “We probably sent about 30,” she said. Finally, in mid-December, she got fed up and started a petition on change.org titled “Make Social Media More Inclusive.” She quickly received about 800 signatures and the bans were lifted.

It could have been a coincidence; Facebook never explicitly acknowledged the petition. But her products were not flagged again until March 2020, when a photo of a woman in a wheelchair demonstrating how a bra worked was rejected for violating the “adult content” policy.

Care + Wear, an adaptive company founded in 2014 that creates “healthwear” — port access shirts and line covers, among other products — spent years being frustrated by the irrational nature of the automated judgment process. One size of a shirt would be rejected by Facebook while the very same shirt in another size was accepted as part of its shop feed. Finally, in March of last year, the company resorted to hiring an outside media buying agency in part because it could actually get a Facebook person on the phone.

“But if you are a small company and can’t afford that, it’s impossible,” said Jim Lahren, the head of marketing.

Abilitee Adaptive, which was founded in 2015 and until late last year made insulin pump belts and ostomy bag covers in bright, eye-catching colors, started advertising their products on Facebook in early 2020; about half of those it submitted were rejected. The company tried changing the language in the ads — it would resubmit some products five times, with different wording — but some bags would be approved and others not.

“The response was very vague, which has been frustrating,” said Marta Elena Cortez-Neavel, one of the founders of Abilitee. In the end, the company stopped trying to advertise on Facebook and Instagram. (Subsequently, the founders split up, and Abilitee is being reorganized.)

Ms. Del Mar Gomez of Mighty Well said she’d had similar problems with language, and on occasion she had to remove so many key words and hashtags from an ad that essentially it became impossible to find. Lucy Jones, the founder of FFora, a company that sells wheelchair accessories like cups and bags, found its products blocked for being “medical equipment.” (“I thought of them more like stroller cups,” she said.) Like Ms. Cortez-Neavel of Abilitee, she simply gave up because she felt that, as a small business, her resources were better used elsewhere.

Alexandra Herold, the founder and sole full-time employee of Patti + Ricky, an online marketplace, said that of approximately 1,000 adaptive fashion products by the 100 designers that it hosts (and wanted to offer on its Facebook store), at least 200 have been mistaken for medical equipment, flagged for “policy violations” and caught up in the appeals process.

Background:This story comes to us from Vice’s Dexter Thomas via the Instagram account of one Sennett Devermont, the citizen on the receiving end of the cop’s silly attempt to game the system.

In the post linked above, we can see video of Sergeant Fair employing the old crank up the music so you can’t hear your parents yelling at you to clean your room tactic as soon as Devermont starts asking too many questions.

Thomas’ reporting makes it clear that this isn’t an isolated incident within the Beverly Hills community, but instead both Fair and other officers have deployed this tactic. One officer is even quoted as not only having knowledge of Devermont’s IG account, but going so far as to mockingly bring up negative comments on posts involving the citizen’s interactions with BHPD.

Laws and rules: The law says that, for the most part, it’s cool for people in California to film law enforcement officers. And, despite what you might believe, Instagram’s rules say that, for the most part, it’s cool for you to post a video that has short moments of copyrighted music playing through it.

Quick take: What we have here is a case of officers of the law trying to weaponize the legal protections a private company is forced to take in order to adhere to the law, against a citizen expressing their Constitutionally-protected right to record the cops under the First Amendment.","Beverly Hills, America",2021.02.05,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/141,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But since these official statements in June, UofT has continued its partnership with exam monitoring services that policymakers, professors, and students say disadvantage BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour) students by causing friction during assessments not faced by students who are white.

In December, The Globe and Mail reported that Chelsea Okankwu, a Concordia University student, faced unexpected conflict verifying her identity at the start of an exam, due to the monitoring software having difficulties identifying her, claiming insufficient lighting.

“I just felt like the only one being disadvantaged, being put in that mindset before an exam,” said Okankwu to The Globe. The Globe noted that the scramble added to her stress at the start of the exam.

The added stress of student monitoring software during exams was echoed by Maame Adjoa, a second-year Global Health major at UofT and the Marketing Director of The Victoria Black Student Network.

“I have observed that during check-in processes, the AI system was often unable to identify my passport and I would be redirected to my human proctor for manual check-ins,” she wrote to The Strand. Her attempts to get the webcam to recognize her passport would take around five of her 15 minutes of check-in time.

She continued: “This in addition to the 360 [degree] room scan, proof of an inactive phone, and a full computer sweep, significantly enhanced the atmosphere of stress already associated with test-taking.”

Okanwu and Adjoa’s experiences with test proctoring software are corroborated by a score of BIPOC students interviewed by The New York Times in September; the San Francisco Chronicle in October; and Reuters in November.

“The likelihood is the people who will be flagged for potentially cheating and have to go through follow-ups are disproportionately likely to be African American and Asian—that goes beyond concerning,” said civil rights attorney Christine Webber to the Chronicle.

These reports of BIPOC subjects facing discriminatory experiences due to facial-recognition software aligns with artificial intelligence research involving UofT, previously reported by the University’s press office in February 2019.

“AI facial-recognition technology has built-in bias,” noted the report’s headline on the UofT Alumni webpage. It continued by lauding Deb Raji for “holding companies accountable” by uncovering this these findings of discrimination in software.

Raji, then a fourth-year engineering student at UofT, co-won a prestigious award for her research on systemic bias with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab. Raji previously recalled experiences of discrimination due to technology.

“I’d build something at a hackathon and wonder why it couldn’t detect my face, or why an automated faucet can’t detect my hand,” she said to UofT Engineering News. Raji reflected that these biases in technology often occur when data sets used to train artificial intelligence models underrepresent BIPOC individuals.

That same month of UofT’s coverage on Raji, the University’s Online Learning Strategies office published a blog post announcing the University’s partnership with ProctorU and Examity—both exam monitoring services aiming to reduce cheating.

In a separate notice about ProctorU, the office noted that “instructors may choose to use in courses” various “levels of service, from automated authentication to live proctoring” with the service.

When asked how the firm is ensuring a fair experience for BIPOC students who use its software, ProctorU underscored its employment of human proctors to issue final decisions of student identity and verify exam integrity.

“It’s important to know that ProctorU is not an ‘automated proctoring service,’” a spokesperson wrote in an email to The Strand. “In fact, in almost all cases and unlike most other remote proctoring providers, ProctorU uses a diverse group of trained human proctors, assisted by technology, to safeguard exam integrity and assist students.”

ProctorU’s statement contradicts the language of its webpage on technical requirements for Chromebook users. The company notes on the webpage that ProctorU supports Chromebook users “for Automated Proctoring,” but not for “Live Proctoring.”

“The University of Toronto has vetted and approved ProctorU’s systems and protocols for remote test proctoring,” the email continued. “Technology never makes the final decision on a person’s identity, nor on potential integrity violations.”

Examity did not respond to The Strand’s request for comment. Examity notes on its website that it offers an “Automated Proctoring” service “with comprehensive auto authentication.”

Problems with these services have also drawn the attention of US Senators. Six Democratic senators, including former 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, wrote an open letter dated to December that highlighted issues of “privacy, accessibility, and equity” with exam monitoring, which cited a New York Times report on an issue of accessibility with a student using ProctorU.

“As we have seen far too often, students have run head-on into the shortcomings of these technologies—shortcomings that fall heavily on vulnerable communities and perpetuate discriminatory biases,” wrote the senators. “Students of color, and students wearing religious dress, like headscarves, have reported issues with the software’s inability to recognize their facial features, temporarily barring them from accessing the software.”

The policymakers also cited an article in the MIT Technology Review by Shea Swauger—a university librarian and academic researcher with the University of Colorado Denver—who has explored how remote proctoring services disadvantage exam-takers who are racialized or have disabilities in the peer-reviewed Hybrid Pedagogy journal.

In an interview with The Strand, Swauger opined that automated testing is not necessary for learning. He noted that university educators can continue to opt for open-book assessments, which he says offer better evaluation for learning instead of memorization-based tests.

He also encouraged assessment through the completion of long-term projects by students, where they receive incremental feedback from educators over time. He notes that project-based learning is far less vulnerable to cheating than exams, and also set the stage for students to gain “meaningful experiences” in their education.

Swauger also spoke in favour of support for undergraduate research experiences—which UofT currently offers—as “meaningful, or tangible [work] connected to what [students] want to do in their profession or discipline” as another way to assess and evaluate students.

Not all exams at UofT are proctored. UofT’s Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation has also acknowledged drawbacks to online proctored exams. A webpage by the Centre notes: “Consider online proctoring only for unique situations or needs given the additional logistical challenges and potential equity issues related to accessing the needed technology.”

However, this advisory is framed as a recommendation instead of a regulation. UofT continues to lack a university-wide policy on online proctoring, in contrast with policies set by McGill University.

“McGill doesn’t use proctoring software,” said Dr. Christopher Buddle, Associate Provost of Teaching and Academic Programs, in an interview with the McGill Reporter. “Instead, the University encourages assessments which are less subject to cheating as they require students to engage with the materials and demonstrate their abilities to use and apply the knowledge appropriately. Not only are those more difficult to cheat on, but the assessment is better aligned with desired learning outcomes.”

Asked why UofT officials have continued to use digital proctoring services when McGill University has decided against using this software, a UofT spokesperson wrote to The Strand: “The University continuously monitors issues that arise around e-proctoring. We have read [The Globe’s report] that you shared carefully. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are fundamental to our learning and teaching environments.”

“While the University of Toronto has existing contracts with both Examity and ProctorU, we do not currently have any degree-program departments or Faculties using Examity. Only a small number of units—largely in the professional programs—are using ProctorU,” continued the spokesperson. “It is the decision of individual Faculties or divisions whether to use these services. The University administration’s clear guidance is that e-proctoring should not be the first or only way that divisions seek to ensure academic integrity on assessments.”

“Any issues that are flagged by the e-proctoring system are reviewed in the first instance by instructors,” the spokesperson added, and highlighted that UofT “offers anti-racism and unconscious bias training to all members of our community.”

Dr. George Dei, a professor at UofT’s Ontario Institute for Studies in Education who studies anti-racism in education, maintained emphasis on the importance of critically questioning the use of proctoring software, in email to The Strand.","Toronto, Canada",2020.06.01,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/140,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate, we conduct two-sets of algorithmic audits for vaccine misinformation on the search and recommendation algorithms of Amazon -- world's leading e-retailer. First, we systematically audit search-results belonging to vaccine-related search-queries without logging into the platform -- unpersonalized audits. We find 10.47% of search-results promote misinformative health products. We also observe ranking-bias, with Amazon ranking misinformative search-results higher than debunking search-results. Next, we analyze the effects of personalization due to account-history, where history is built progressively by performing various real-world user-actions, such as clicking a product. We find evidence of filter-bubble effect in Amazon's recommendations; accounts performing actions on misinformative products are presented with more misinformation compared to accounts performing actions on neutral and debunking products. Interestingly, once user clicks on a misinformative product, homepage recommendations become more contaminated compared to when user shows an intention to buy that product.

Introduction: The recent onset of coronavirus pandemic has unleashed a barrage of online health misinformation [4, 22] and renewed focus on the anti-vaccine movement, with anti-vax social media accounts witnessing a 19% increase in their follower base [49]. As scientists work towards creating a vaccine for the disease, health experts worry that vaccine hesitancy could make it difficult to achieve herd immunity against the new virus [3]. Battling health misinformation, especially anti-vaccine misinformation has never been more important.

Statistics show that people increasingly rely on the internet [53], and specifically online search engines [8], for health information including information about medical treatments, immunizations, vaccinations and vaccine-related side effects [6, 23]. Yet, the algorithms powering search engines are not traditionally designed to take into account the credibility and trustworthiness of such information. Search platforms being the primary gateway and reportedly the most trusted source [19], persistent vaccine misinformation on them, can cause serious health ramifications [38]. Thus, there has been a growing interest in empirically investigating search engine results for health misinformation. While multiple studies have performed audits on commercial search engines to investigate problematic behaviour [35, 36, 56], e-commerce platforms have received little to no attention ([11, 59] are two exceptions), despite critics calling e-commerce platforms, like Amazon, a “dystopian” store for hosting anti-vaccine books [17]. Amazon specifically has faced criticism from several technology critics for not regulating health-related products on its platform [5, 55]. Consider the most recent instance. Several medically unverified products for coronavirus treatment, like prayer healing, herbal treatments and antiviral vitamin supplements proliferated Amazon [18, 28], so much so that the company had to remove 1 million fake products after several instances of such treatments were reported by the media [22]. The scale of the problematic content suggests that Amazon could be a great enabler of misinformation, especially health misinformation. It not only hosts problematic health-related content but its recommendation algorithms drive engagement by pushing potentially dubious health products to users of the system [27, 59]. Thus, in this paper we investigate Amazon—world’s leading e-retailer—for most critical form of health misinformation—vaccine misinformation.

What is the amount of misinformation present in Amazon’s search results and recommendations? How does personalization due to user history built progressively by performing real-world user actions, such as clicking or browsing certain products, impact the amount of misinformation returned in subsequent search results and recommendations? In this paper, we dabble into these questions. We conduct 2 sets of systematic audit experiments: Unpersonalized audit and Personalized audit. In the Unpersonalized audit, we adopt Information Retrieval metrics from prior work [42] to determine the amount of health misinformation users are exposed to when searching for vaccine-related queries. In particular, we examine search-results of 48 search queries belonging to 10 popular vaccinerelated topics like ‘hpv vaccine’, ‘immunization’, ‘MMR vaccine and autism’, etc. We collect search results without logging in to Amazon to eliminate the influence of personalization. To gain indepth insights about the platform’s searching and sorting algorithm, our Unpersonalized audits ran for 15 consecutive days, sorting the search results across 5 different Amazon filters each day: “featured”, “price low to high”, “price high to low”, “average customer review” and “newest arrivals”. The first audit resulted in 36,000 search results and 16,815 product page recommendations which we later annotated for their stance on health misinformation—promoting, neutral or debunking.

In our second set of audit—Personalized audit, we determine the impact of personalization due to user history on the amount of health misinformation returned in search results, recommendations and auto-complete suggestions. User history is built progressively over 7 days by performing several real-world actions, such as “search” , “search + click”, “search + click + add to cart”, “search + click + mark top-rated all positive review as helpful”, “follow contributor” and “search on third party website” ( Google.com in our case) . We collect several Amazon components in our Personalized audit, like homepages, product pages, pre-purchase pages, search results, etc. Our audits reveal that Amazon hosts a plethora of health misinformative products belonging to several categories, including Books, Kindle eBooks, Amazon Fashion (e.g. apparel, t-shirt, etc.) and Health & Personal care items (e.g. dietary supplements). We also establish the presence of a filter-bubble effect in Amazon’s recommendations, where recommendations of misinformative health products contain more health misinformation.",Global,2021.01.21,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/139,,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

University of Illinois to discontinue remote-testing software

According to TechNewsTube, the University of Illinois has been using Proctorio for years in a classroom setting and the software has been available for years. However, it was only in 2020 that the public, especially the students took notice when they were forced to home school due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The software received major backlash from the students, the schools staff and the general public as they pointed out that it invades the students' personal space and it gives them anxiety over the thought of being closely monitored.

There were also accusations of discrimintation towards marginalized students, as the software allegedly recognizes white face more than it does with faces of students of color.

But what exactly is Proctorio and what does it do?

Proctorio is a software used by colleges and universities to monitor students and prevent cheating during exams.

It uses a machine learning technology and it uses advanced facial detection to record students through their webcams as they take their test and the software monitor the positions of the students' head.

If the software detects any suspicious behavior, it automatically notifies the professors, who can review the recordings. The software also enables the professors to see the websites that their students opened while they were taking the test, and it disables computer functions like copying, pasting and printing.

Privacy concerns

Also the software is helpful in the grand scheme of things, the idea of being monitored does not sit well with students and even other teachers.

The University of Illinois has been using Proctorio in a classroom setting during examination period, but due to the pandemic, students were forced to bring it to their homes, which invades their privacy.

Because of this, more than 1,000 people, students and teachers alike, signed a petition asking the university to discontinue the software.

Proctorio is not the only remote-testing software that is used by colleges and universities, a university in Miami was also forced to discontinue a remote-testing software after a petition with more than 500 signatures was passed, citing the same issues.

The software ProctorTrack, a remote-testing software used by the University of Regina, will also get the boot after a petition with 3,500 signatures was passed. Honorlock, a smiliar software used by the University of Central Floria, will also be discontinued after a petition with 1,200 signatures was passed.

No matter what type of remote-testing software is used and in which university the petition was given, the main concern is the same. Students, teachers and even parents are worried about security and privacy.

Proctorio's feature which lets professors record their students through webcams is problematic enough, let alone having access to the computer activities of the students. And also, since students are now taking classes at home through their webcams, the software can record parts of the students' home.

Aside from privacy, discrimination is another factor that made students ask for the end of the software. Proctorio, in particular, can't propery identify the students because it can't properly recognized dark skined students.

This issue can lead to confusion in the university, and it is obvious that the software is built for lighter skined individuals. Students with darker skin tones are in danger of being falsely accused of cheating because of the software's failure to recorgnize them.

Despite the study and evidence shown, Proctorio denied that the software discriminates individuals who use it. The company claims that lighting, the position of the webcam and the quality of the webcam are the only factors why it won't work, and it has nothing to do with a person's skin tone.",America,2021.01.29,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/138,,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,When an Israeli Farmer Declared War on an Algorithm,AI supervision,uncertain,Israel’s tax authority,rancher,A tax dispute between a ranch in Israel’s southern Negev desert and the country’s tax authority has given rise to an issue which could have far reaching repercussions on the public’s ability to oversee and even understand government acts.,There may be some systemic problems with the algorithm.,"Data acquisition,Data modeling","1.

2. The tax authority: The Tax Authority argued in court that it had no way to extract the guidelines from the software, because it wasn’t a matter of merely pressing a button, and that it would demand an unreasonable allocation of resources.“To obtain the guidelines would require the authority to use reverse engineering techniques and to trace the programming processes,” the authority wrote. “It’s not at all certain that these techniques will yield the desired results. Also, it would oblige the authority to set up a team of programmers to identify all the computer’s software dealing with this request.”",Negative,Farmers appealed the algorithm,"A tax dispute between a ranch in Israel’s southern Negev desert and the country’s tax authority has given rise to an issue which could have far reaching repercussions on the public’s ability to oversee and even understand government acts.

The issue, currently being debated in the Justice Ministry, is whether a software or its source code can be seen as “information” the authorities are obliged to disclose to the public.

The story began in 2014 when the farm Har Shemesh, which is not part of any community, asked the Tax Authority to explain how it had calculated a fine they were required to pay.

The authority officials couldn’t explain how they had arrived at the fine’s final amount, claiming the calculation had been carried out automatically by their computer software. The farm owners asked for more details, eventually requesting the program or it's source code so that they could examine the formula by which their fine was calculated. However, the Tax Authority refused.

The District Court rejected the farm’s appeal to receive the program's code and accepted the state’s position. The farm then appealed to the Supreme Court and The Movement for Freedom of Information joined the case. The state retracted its position and the Justice Ministry is now debating the issue.

Software discretion

The farm, represented by its owner Moshe Har Shemesh, argued that the Tax Authority’s computer was programmed to exercise discretion instead of the authority’s officials. He said the software has the authority to do what tax clerks are supposed to do: imposes fines on belated income statements, deducts tax returns, slaps financial sanctions and even denies the right for deduction at source.

The authority’s decision to grant a software program these powers is a decision, he claims, which was made as an administrative measure, with no public discussion and in the absence of sufficient public awareness of the implications, he argued.

Not only was the discretion given to the computer, but the guidelines for carrying it out were not released to the public or even to the authority’s employees themselves, he said.

“When a computerized system is tasked with implementing the procedure, then the operation guidelines are programmed into the software. They are unpublished and unknown, apart from those ‘programming gurus’ who programmed them into the computer language,” he said.

Har Shemsh mentioned a class action lawsuit submitted by Aiad Mahajna, who discovered that the same tax authority computer would re-calculate fines over delayed VAT payments only when the consumer price index went up, but not when the index went down. The guidelines given to the program in the case had not been put in writing and neither the prosecutor nor the public had any way of understanding them. They could only be inferred by laborious data gathering. The judge ruled in the other case in favor of the plaintiff and ordered Israel to pay compensation over 2 million shekel.

The Tax Authority argued in court that it had no way to extract the guidelines from the software, because it wasn’t a matter of merely pressing a button, and that it would demand an unreasonable allocation of resources.

“To obtain the guidelines would require the authority to use reverse engineering techniques and to trace the programming processes,” the authority wrote. “It’s not at all certain that these techniques will yield the desired results. Also, it would oblige the authority to set up a team of programmers to identify all the computer’s software dealing with this request.”

The authority estimated that the task would take thousands of programmer’s work hours.

As for giving the software itself to the appellant so that they could extract the guidelines from it themselves, the authority claimed that this would endanger state security.

Such a move, the authority claims, could disrupt its function, because it opens the software to hostile agents who could attack the authority’s critical computer system and render it vulnerable to cyber threats and data leaks, thus disrupting the tax system and other things.

Legal programs

Jerusalem District Judge Ram Vinograd said software cannot constitute information, as it is rather an external product of it, or a “work tool.” The judge argued that the request was tantamount to if a government office would order an interior designer to rework their office so it would meet legal guidelines and thus the very office itself would become “information” by virtue of it being based on those requirements.

A work tool, whether it’s an office or a cutting machine or a program, he said, doesn’t turn into “information” because it was created to serve legal ends or meet legal requirements.

He also ruled that the authority, which created the software and had its guidelines programmed into it, is the software’s intellectual property owner. This property has financial value, even if the authority doesn’t plan to sell it.

In contrast, Har Shemesh argued that administrative guidelines, whether in a paper folder or a computer software, cannot be the authority’s private intellectual property, just like the Knesset isn’t the copyright owner of the legislation and amendments it issues.

As for financial value, just as it’s unthinkable for Israel to purchase from Iceland the guidelines to implement the latter’s tax laws, so it’s unthinkable that some state would buy Israel’s administrative guidelines.

He also said that claiming the software has financial value contradicts the claim that the software was secret and releasing it could harm state security.

“If giving the information to someone could harm state security, then obviously it has no commercial value, because the authority would never sell it and compromise state security,” he said.

The Movement for Freedom of Information, an apolitical NGO set up to advance the right for information in Israel, asked to join the appeal as a friend of the court and show why the term “information” consists of all information that can be passed on – including software, code or algorithm.

The NGO said the freedom of information law was intended to enable the public to supervise government activities and that in a technological world, where decisions are also made by computers – software must be open to scrutiny as well. The public cannot supervise the government if the law is “hidden” in a program's algorithm. Also, it totally exempts the gatekeepers from self examination.

The NGO’s activists said that for years government officials have been using various computer software, such as commercial off-the-shelf software, or software made for the state by commercial companies. In many cases the software arrives with only an executable file (.exe file) written in computer language, unlike a source code that is understood by the programmers. In this case, the entire supervision is conditioned on reverse engineering, in which prolonged experiments are conducted on the software to learn about its source code. In the absence of a human being to make the decision and without an open-source software, there is no real supervisor – a public employee, a gatekeeper or the public - on the way decisions are made.

Human beings, like Tax Authority employees in this case, have a tendency to rely on the machine’s decision, but the result the machine reaches isn’t necessarily the right one, and the machine’s decisions must be supervised. This isn’t a theoretical claim – a software assessing inmates’ danger in the United States, for example, attributed considerable significance to the detainee’s skin color and increased structural biases in the justice system.

Open-source state software

The NGO says considerations in designing the program or artificial intelligence now replacing, albeit partially, human judgment, must be open to the public. The privacy laws in Europe's GDPR require that in the case of automatic computer decisions, information is provided regarding the reasoning involved in the decision, its significance and its expected implications.A French law from 2016 obliges to explain decisions including the programing processes that led to it.

In order to do this, the state must have full access to software it operates, and even have be open-source, with the code and software being open to all. This allows it to be examined by others.

The use of open-source software will enable finding bugs in a program's code and allow oversight of the way the software was constructed or implemented. It will also enable the developers community to improve the code and trace vulnerabilities in it, the NGO says.

The NGO’s position was written by the movement’s CEO lawyer Rachely Edri and lawyer Or Sadan, with the assistance of the students Shir Toledano, Shahar Mandil and Igor Bistrov from Sadan’s freedom of information clinic in The College of Management Academic Studies.

Don’t get me wrong. Getting brand safety right is hard. That’s because words have meaning, phrases may have different meanings, the English language has many puns and idioms, and context matters.

Despite their claims of advanced AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) in their sales materials, it was painfully clear the brand safety technology was blocking ads based on simple keyword lists. This is not a new phenomenon, just more easily observable at the start of the pandemic when ads on the front pages of New York Times and Wall Street Journal were blocked and replaced by “cloud ads” just because the page contained the word “covid-19” or “coronavirus.” So while these brand safety technologies were being paid for by advertisers, hoping that would help keep ads off of not-brand-safe sites, they were instead blocking advertisers’ ads on legitimate mainstream news sites. The result of this blocking is that more ads and dollars flow to lower quality sites in programmatic channels - the exact opposite effect to what advertisers thought would happen.

(Source: AdAge)

Getting brand safety right at scale is even harder. Brand safety technology either has a few milliseconds to determine if a page is brand safe or unsafe when their detection tag is in the ad iframe, or the tech has to do mass crawling to index billions of webpages and millions of sites. These crawlers are software programs that load the webpages and collect all the text content on the page for brand safety analysis. The challenge is that modern webpages change often or have dynamic content loaded by javascript (e.g. weather, sports scores, news, slideshows, etc.). The content can change after the brand safety crawler makes a “brand safety” determination for the page. This means a page that was marked “safe” may no longer be safe, or a site marked “unsafe” may no longer be “unsafe.” Furthermore, fraudsters operating fake sites meticulously avoid keywords most often marked as “brand_unsafe” and thus get all the ads and ad dollars that were blocked from going to mainstream legitimate publishers like New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc.

In the tables above are examples of “content classifiers” seen in the largest ad network. Look closely at the domains and how they were classified. Some categories are clearly wrong while others may simply be incomplete and imprecise — and the entire site cannot be easily categorized into one category, just like songs may not fit neatly into only one genre of music. We have reviewed cases in the past where entire sites get blocked or blacklisted due to not brand-safe content on a few pages. CBSnews.com being marked as “weapons” is likely that there was a news item that contained the word “weapons.”

Quantifying the Negative Impact on Publishers’ Ad Revenue

We knew brand safety tech was bad (didn’t work as well as they promised) and was bad news (lowers the ad revenue of legitimate publishers), but we didn’t know exactly how bad the situation was. New research published today by Adalytics helps quantify the negative impact of brand safety technologies on mainstream publishers’ ad revenues. “This exploratory study shows an estimated 21% of economist.com articles, 30% of nytimes.com, 30% of wsj.com, and 52% of articles on vice.com are being labeled as ‘brand unsafe’. When a page is marked “brand_unsafe” the signal is passed to real-time bidding. Marketers choosing to avoid unsafe environments would have their ads blocked from these pages and sites.

But are the brand safety designations accurate? Previous evidence suggests each vendor’s labeling is problematic at best and entirely wrong at worst. By comparing different vendors’ designations we can quantify how inaccurate their labeling is — for example, when two vendors categorize the same article differently, as safe or unsafe. Based on a sample of 25,730 wsj.com articles found in various internet archive repositories, it appears that Moat and Comscore disagree about 40% of the time when classifying an article as “safe” or “unsafe.”

In other words, “for every 10 articles on wsj.com, an average of four would receive conflicting brand safety values be labeled as ‘safe’/‘unsafe’ or ‘unsafe’/‘safe’ by the two vendors.” The data also suggests that the brand safety detection technologies did not look for text inside images or analyze images for brand safety issues.

Outsized Negative Impact on Serious Topics and High Traffic Pages

Finally, data from the study shows how journalists who focus on certain ‘serious’ topics, such as Middle East affairs, obituaries, or certain political events, are disproportionately likely to have their work marked as ‘unsafe’ by brand safety vendors.” This causes ads to be blocked and these mainstream news sites to be defunded. Even a recent article about the death of Argentine football player Diego Maradona was marked as ‘moat_unsafe’ and ‘gv_death_injury’. Biomedical articles that use the term “cell death” as a synonym for apoptosis are similarly flagged as “brand_unsafe” because of the word “death.”

Beyond the percent of all pages defunded by brand safety tech, if high traffic pages like the homepage are blocked due to being “brand_unsafe” the impact on ad revenues is disproportionally higher than if low volume article pages are blocked. Mainstream sites’s homepages are by far the highest trafficked pages of the entire website. The graphic from Adalytics below shows the homepage of the New York Times and the articles linked from the homepage. Note the articles marked in red boxes - those are marked as “brand_unsafe” by brand safety vendors. The negative impact of brand safety tech on mainstream publishers’ sites is visible and significant. Marketers’ use of brand safety tech is defunding legitimate sites and funding bad ones, the opposite of the intended effect.

So What? What Can Marketers Do Instead?

Stop wasting money on brand safety tech that does not work and is actively causing more harm. As we’ve seen above, the use of brand safety detection vendors is bad for publishers — ads blocked due to incorrect brand safety measurements means those publishers lose ad revenue. Use of brand safety detection vendors is also bad for advertisers — ads are blocked from mainstream websites, so the ads and ad budgets flow to worse sites. Paying for brand safety technology that doesn’t work well or doesn’t work at all is like throwing good money after bad. It’s like solving a problem that wouldn’t exist if marketers bought ads from mainstream, good publishers in the first place, instead of spraying their ads out on millions of long tail sites that no one has ever seen or visited. It’s like trying to detect your way out of trouble using faulty, rudimentary technology, and that’s literally a fool's errand. Brand safety detection vendors will be the first to insist you have to keep paying for their tech or else your ads may end up next to a terrorist beheading video. But your ads would not end up there if you didn’t place ads on UGC (user generated content) in the first place, similarly for millions of long tail sites in programmatic channels.

For starters, marketers should move to using strict “include lists” with sites that have real human audiences. As a simple thought exercise, ask yourself how many sites do humans know about and visit regularly. Examine your own personal experience every day. How many sites do you visit regularly every day? Marketers can save money by NOT renewing and NOT paying for brand safety detection tech that does more harm than good, and run ads on real, good, mainstream publishers. Common sense will tell you ads running on an Economist article about the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona are not “brand_unsafe” even if BS detection tech marks it as such.",Global,2020.12.06,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/136,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was never used to make decisions to admit or reject prospective students, as at least one faculty member directly evaluates applicants at each stage of the review process.",Negative,No relevant measures have been taken so far.,"U of Texas at Austin has stopped using a machine-learning system to evaluate applicants for its Ph.D. in computer science. Critics say the system exacerbates existing inequality in the field.

In 2013, the University of Texas at Austin’s computer science department began using a machine-learning system called GRADE to help make decisions about who gets into its Ph.D. program -- and who doesn’t. This year, the department abandoned it.

Before the announcement, which the department released in the form of a tweet reply, few had even heard of the program. Now, its critics -- concerned about diversity, equity and fairness in admissions -- say it should never have been used in the first place.

“Humans code these systems. Humans are encoding their own biases into these algorithms,” said Yasmeen Musthafa, a Ph.D. student in plasma physics at the University of California, Irvine, who rang alarm bells about the system on Twitter. “What would UT Austin CS department have looked like without GRADE? We’ll never know.”

GRADE (which stands for GRaduate ADmissions Evaluator) was created by a UT faculty member and UT graduate student in computer science, originally to help the graduate admissions committee in the department save time. GRADE predicts how likely the admissions committee is to approve an applicant and expresses that prediction as a numerical score out of five. The system also explains what factors most impacted its decision.

The UT researchers who made GRADE trained it on a database of past admissions decisions. The system uses patterns from those decisions to calculate its scores for candidates.

For example, letters of recommendation containing the words “best,” “award,” “research” or “Ph.D.” are predictive of admission -- and can lead to a higher score -- while letters containing the words “good,” “class,” “programming” or “technology” are predictive of rejection. A higher grade point average means an applicant is more likely to be accepted, as does the name of an elite college or university on the résumé. Within the system, institutions were encoded into the categories “elite,” “good” and “other,” based on a survey of UT computer science faculty.

Every application GRADE scored during the seven years it was in use was still reviewed by at least one human committee member, UT Austin has said, but sometimes only one. Before GRADE, faculty members made multiple review passes over the pool. The system saved the committee time, according to its developers, by allowing faculty to focus on applicants on the cusp of admission or rejection and review applicants in descending order of quality.

For what it’s worth, GRADE did appear to successfully save the committee time. In the 2012 and 2013 application seasons, developers said in a paper about their work, it reduced the number of full reviews per candidate by 71 percent and cut the total time reviewing files by 74 percent. (One full review typically takes 10 to 30 minutes.) Between the years 2000 and 2012, applications to the computer science Ph.D. program grew from about 250 to nearly 650, though the number of faculty able to review those applications remained mostly constant. In the years since 2012, the number of applications has reached over 1,200.

The university’s use of the technology escaped attention for a number of years, until this month, when the physics department at the University of Maryland at College Park held a colloquium talk with the two creators of GRADE.

The talk gained attention on Twitter as graduate students accused GRADE’s creators of further disadvantaging underrepresented groups in the computer science admissions process.

“We put letters of recommendation in to try to lift people up who have maybe not great GPAs. We put a personal statement in the graduate application process to try to give marginalized folks a chance to have their voice heard,” said Musthafa, who is also a member of the Physics and Astronomy Anti-Racism Coalition. “The worst part about GRADE is that it throws that out completely.”

Advocates have long been concerned about the potential for human biases to be baked into or exacerbated by machine-learning algorithms. Algorithms are trained on data. When it comes to people, what those data look like is a result of historical inequity. Preferences for one type of person over another are often the result of conscious or unconscious bias.

That hasn’t stopped institutions from using machine-learning systems in hiring, policing and prison sentencing for a number of years now, often to great controversy.

“Every process is going to make some mistakes. The question is, where are those mistakes likely to be made and who is likely to suffer as a result of them?” said Manish Raghavan, a computer science Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University who has researched and written about bias in algorithms. “Likely those from underrepresented groups or people who don’t have the resources to be attending elite institutions.”

Though many women and people who are Black and Latinx have had successful careers in computer science, those groups are underrepresented in the field at large. In 2017, whites, Asians and nonresident aliens received 84 percent of degrees awarded for computer science in the United States.

At UT, nearly 80 percent of undergraduates in computer science in 2017 were men.

Raghavan said he was surprised that there appeared to be no effort to audit the impacts of GRADE, such as how scores differ across demographic groups.

GRADE’s creators have said that the system is only programmed to replicate what the admissions committee was doing prior to 2013, not to make better decisions than humans could. The system isn’t programmed to use race or gender to make its predictions, they’ve said. In fact, when given those features as options to help make its predictions, it chooses to give them zero weight. GRADE’s creators have said this is evidence that the committee’s decisions are gender and race neutral.

Detractors have countered this, arguing that race and gender can be encoded into other features of the application that the system uses. Women’s colleges and historically Black universities may be undervalued by the algorithm, they’ve said. Letters of recommendation are known to reflect gender bias, as recommenders are more likely to describe female students as “caring” rather than “assertive” or “trailblazing.”

In the Maryland talk, faculty raised their own concerns. What a committee is looking for might change each year. Letters of recommendation and personal statements should be thoughtfully considered, not turned into a bag of words, they said.

“I’m kind of shocked you did this experiment on your students,” Steve Rolston, chair of the physics department at Maryland, said during the talk. “You seem to have built a model that builds in whatever bias your committee had in 2013 and you’ve been using it ever since.”

In an interview, Rolston said graduate admissions can certainly be a challenge. His department receives over 800 graduate applications per year, which takes a good deal of time for faculty to evaluate. But, he said, his department would never use a tool like this.

“If I ask you to do a classifier of images and you’re looking for dogs, I can check afterwards that, yes, it did correctly identify dogs,” he said. “But when I’m asking for decisions about people, whether it's graduate admissions, or hiring or prison sentencing, there’s no obvious correct answer. You train it, but you don’t know what the result is really telling you.”

Rolston said having at least one faculty member review each application was not a convincing safeguard.

“If I give you a file and say, ‘Well, the algorithm said this person shouldn’t be accepted,’ that will inevitably bias the way you look at it,” he said.

UT Austin has said GRADE was used to organize admissions decisions, rather than make them.

""It was never used to make decisions to admit or reject prospective students, as at least one faculty member directly evaluates applicants at each stage of the review process,"" a spokesperson for the Graduate School said via email.

Despite the criticism around diversity and equity, UT Austin has said GRADE is being phased out because it is too difficult to maintain.

“Changes in the data and software environment made the system increasingly difficult to maintain, and its use was discontinued,” the spokesperson said via email. “The Graduate School works with graduate programs and faculty members across campus to promote holistic application review and reduce bias in admissions decisions.”

For Musthafa, the fact that GRADE may be gone for good does not impact the existing inequity in graduate admissions.

“The entire system is steeped in racism, sexism and ableism,” they said. “How many years of POC computer science students got denied [because of this]?”

Addressing that inequity -- as well as the competitiveness that led to the creation of GRADE -- may mean expanding committees, paying people for their time and giving Black and Latinx graduate students a voice in those decisions, they said. But automating cannot be part of that decision making.",America,2020.12.14,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/135,,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a social media content creator and before Monday December 14th, 2020, I had grown my audience to 300K+ followers on my TikTok account. (@RosalynneMontoya).

One of my videos about injecting my estrogen was reported. Shortly after I posted it, I received a notification that my account was permanently deleted and banned for violating the community guidelines. This was wrong. I’m always sure to follow the community guidelines of the platform I’m posting on. Myself, alongside many other creators, especially BIPOC, LGBTQPIA+, and those living with disabilities, are being targeted by trolls who are intentionally falsely reporting our content with the goal to delete our videos from the app.

TikTok’s algorithm allows these discriminatory actions to censor our content.I have appealed the decision to delete my account, but received the notification that they have reviewed my appeal and “it was determined that my account violates community guidelines and cannot be restored.” I am eagerly waiting TikTok’s email for a full explanation.

I use my social media accounts to educate people. I share my story, my transition, my surgeries, etc. I also invite my sister who is Deaf to help me teach people ASL.

I recently started a series on TikTok about trans history after receiving a hate comment stating that being trans is just a new trendy thing, when in fact we have always existed. I often respond to hate comments with humor and education. I strive to live by the words: kill them with kindness. Working as an educator can be difficult, but it’s important and fulfilling as well. I receive thousands of messages from people thanking me for the work I do, for inspiring them, and even for changing their minds.

This last month, as my following has exponentially grown, I’ve noticed more and more hate comments and trolls. Having been a content creator for a long time, I’m used to blocking hate comments and even death threats. However, the community guidelines violations on TikTok work differently from the other platforms I use. The guidelines in place are general and vague. There is little transparency on why TikTok removes or does not remove content. They also do not give reasons on why an appeal was denied. The community guidelines should be in place to protect the community. Creators shouldn’t have to put up with discrimination, hateful comments, or death threats. The algorithm should work to protect marginalized people, not discriminate against us.

From what I’ve gathered, if enough people report a video on TikTok (even if it’s a false report) the video is removed automatically, regardless of whether the video actually violated the guidelines or not. This can be appealed and if approved by a computer program, the content will be available again.

The problem, though, is that this leaves a flag on the account reported. After enough violations (even if appealed and deemed to be appropriate) an account can be deleted. The current algorithm is flawed and is allowing many people who are breaking the community guidelines to slip through the cracks, and many of us who follow them are being deleted and censored due to hateful trolls with an agenda to have our content removed from the app.

In the last month I have had many videos reported and removed due to false claims of violating TikTok’s community guidelines. The majority of my appeals were approved and most of my content was allowed back on TikTok. At the same time, I was also warned multiple times while live-streaming that my content was ‘vulgar’, even though I wasn’t breaking any of the community guidelines.

After being continuously reported, my appeals to go live were declined. I was banned from live more than 4 times for being a trans Latina woman while speaking about beauty tips, music, and my transition while wearing tank tops or bralettes. Each time I was reported the timespan of the ban was increased.

In the few weeks before my account was deleted, I had to consistently block the same person over and over ( @ey.yo.wtf ). His goal was to use my content for his own gain while spreading discrimination against my community. He would screen record my content (including a video with my 17 year Deaf old sister) then use it to spread hate on his page. He has reposted at least 7 of my videos (without tagging me) followed by his crude commentary.

These were brought to my attention thanks to my followers who sent them to me. I reported these videos, but TikTok’s algorithm concluded that they do not violate their community guidelines. After blocking him, he made another account and spammed my videos. Every time I blocked him, he came back again and eventually his friends joined in as well. From having so many wrongful reports of violating community guidelines, I was notified that my bio had been deleted. I appealed this and it was immediately restored. I had no idea these trolls held the power to have my entire account deleted from the app. These creators laughed when my account was deleted and are already spamming my new account.

After my appeal was denied, I went live on my new TikTok account, one of the trolls entered the live and reported me. I was banned from livestreaming for 24hours for “serious pornography.” I was wearing a tanktop.

Many fellow creators have noticed that they are also being targeted for being BIPOC, LGBTQPIA+, living with a disability, etc. Our content is being wrongfully reported by discriminatory haters. As a result, TikTok’s algorithm allows our content to be censored, banned, and deleted. We are just as deserving to use the app as these other people. Internet trolls should not hold more power than content creators.

I would like to ask TikTok to sit down with myself and other creators to discuss their community guidelines, and how they can improve the app to be more inclusive. I want my account back and the funds I accrued through the TikTok Creator Fund, but I also want to see real change to the algorithm and transparency with how their community guidelines function.

Real people—not just computer programs— should be involved before accounts are deleted. The community guidelines should not be able to be used as a tool to discriminate and target marginalized people.

I applaud other social media platforms that have created advisory boards where content creators can hold the platform accountable. I want to create content on platforms that protect the community, but I don’t wish to create content on platforms that censor my content simply for being trans and Latina.",America,2020.12.15,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/133,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The app is rife with dangerous material including 'pro-ana' or pro-anorexia and 'pro-mia' or pro-bulimia content which has plagued other social media networks such as Tumblr in the past.

Its algorithm means if users engage with harmful content then TikTok will continue to show them it, and even if they don't engage with it, it may appear on their For You Page regardless.

The app has 800m active users, 41% of whom are aged between 16 and 24, according to Datereportal and Globalwebindex.

TikTok said that it had banned six accounts for posting content promoting eating habits that are likely to lead to health problems in its latest effort to crack down on harmful content.

The ban, earlier in December, came after a Guardian investigation found pro-anorexia material was still searchable on the platform.

The app has struggled with dangerous material including 'pro-ana' or pro-anorexia and 'pro-mia' or pro-bulimia content which plagued other social media networks such as Tumblr in the past.

The platform banned content labeled #proana and #anorexia which had 2.1m and 446,000 views respectively in the summer, according to Mashable UK. Users who searched for them were redirected to a support page titled ""Need Help?""

However, if they are entered as words rather than hashtags then the content remains accessible and users have also been able to bypass the ban using common misspellings of popular search terms.

Tom Quinn, Director of External Affairs at eating disorder charity, Beat told Insider: ""It is vital that TikTok continue to update their safety procedures in order to reduce the ability of their users to post or find harmful content. This should include identifying where misspellings of common hashtags are used in order to circumvent the rules.""

Danae Mercer, a journalist and body image influencer based in the UAE began talking about body confidence for various reasons including struggling with an eating disorder when she was 19.

She told Insider: ""Social media, like the pro-ana communities on Tumblr and websites, discussing celebrity weight loss really escalated my illness so I'm trying to help make social media a safer space, the kind I needed when I was sick.

""Those communities massively fuel eating disorders, helping them become a cycle where the illness is encouraged, tips are shared, and being sicker is applauded.""

How TikTok works

TikTok has 800m active users worldwide, 41% of whom are aged between 16 and 24, according to Datereportal and Globalwebindex.

TikTok is unique from other networks because of its For You Page (FYP) algorithm, the inner workings of which the Chinese owned app recently revealed in an effort to be more transparent.

When a video is uploaded, it is shown to a small group of users regardless of whether they follow the account it came from or not.

If they engage with the video, either by liking, sharing, or even watching it all, then it will be presented to an even larger group.

If this larger group reacts well, then it is shown to an even larger group and the process continues until the clip eventually goes viral.

Therefore, if users engage with harmful content then TikTok will continue to show them it, trapping them in a vicious cycle, and even if they don't engage with it, it may appear on their FYP regardless.

In a statement, TikTok said users searching for eating disorder-related content will be redirected to the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) helpline and that it would prohibit ads promoting fasting apps and weight loss gimmicks to under 18s.

Last year, Pinterest also tackled this issue by training its algorithm to recognize content that promotes self-harm with the company reporting that those pins were down by 88%, Wired reported.",Amercia,2020.12.27,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/132,,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, this video shows the California Committee of Bar Examiners revealing that of the 9,301 people who took the exam, 3,190 of them were flagged by the software. That’s 1 in 3!

Put aside whether or not software that flags a third of applicants is really doing its job — which is a good question! — when bar examiners are told that “it looks like 33 percent of the applicants cheated” the reaction should be “that’s obviously poppycock.” Instead California seems to be rolling with the “order to show cause” approach of asking a bunch, if not the bulk, of people flagged by the software to prove they weren’t cheating.

This is lunacy. The “Chapter 6” notices that California is sending around say stuff like “Facial view of your eyes was not within view of the camera for a prolonged period of time” which should be an invitation for the examiners to watch the goddamned video to see if it’s valid before bringing the applicant into it. This description is so generic that it’s clear the examiners never even bothered to look into these flags. Someone who looked at it and detected something suspicious would say “hey, the camera shows you repeatedly looking at your lap” not this vague garbage.

One notice sent around was “no audible sound was detected” which is a real trick because PEOPLE WEREN’T SUPPOSED TO MAKE NOISE. I get that they’re alleging that someone turned off their microphone or something, but that’s something that could be verified with further investigation. Why add unnecessary stress?

If California wasn’t ready to actually deal with the flags then they shouldn’t have gone with an online exam. It’s part of the deal. You make the exam online and that means more post-hoc proctoring. Farming it out to “prove us wrong” is utterly unacceptable.

Worse, reports are emerging on social media that applicants are being told that they have to respond to these vague allegations without seeing the video for themselves which sounds like an issue spotter. Hopefully these are just rumors because if the bar examiners are really trying to tag applicants based on a hastily composed algorithm that we already know creates false positives without access to the only relevant evidence… well that would be a new low.","California, America",2020.12.04,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/131,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cloud computing unit of Alibaba, Alibaba Cloud, developed a facial recognition algorithm that can identify a person’s ethnicity or whether a person is “Uyghur”, according to research from surveillance industry publication IPVM.

China has repeatedly defended its controversial “vocational training programs” imposed upon its Muslim ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, Kazakhs and others, as part of what the government calls counterterrorism efforts.

Alibaba said in a statement that it is “dismayed” to learn that Alibaba Cloud tested a technology that included “ethnicity as an algorithm” and that “racial or ethnic discrimination or profiling in any form violates Alibaba’s policies and values.”

“We never intended our technology to be used for and will not permit it to be used for targeting specific ethnic groups, and we have eliminated any ethnic tag in our product offering. This trial technology was not deployed by any customer. We do not and will not permit our technology to be used to target or identify specific ethnic groups,” the company added.

A security breach from last year revealed that a “smart city” surveillance system hosted on Alibaba Cloud could detect people’s ethnicity or label them Uyghur Muslim, TechCrunch reported earlier. At the time, Alibaba said as a public cloud provider, it “does not have the right to access the content in the customer database.”

IPVM also found earlier this month that Huawei and artificial intelligence unicorn Megvii, known for its facial recognition product Face++, jointly developed a technology that could alert the Chinese government when the system detected the face of a member from the Uyghur community.

As China’s tech upstarts seek overseas growth, they increasingly find themselves stuck between the demands of Beijing and international scrutiny over their stance on human rights issues.

Cloud computing is one of Alibaba’s fastest-growing segments and the giant is eyeing to attract more international customers. Last year, Alibaba Cloud was the biggest player in the Asia Pacific region and the third-largest infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider globally, according to research firm Gartner.

Alibaba’s cloud unit grew 60% year-over-year to account for nearly 10% of the firm’s revenues in the three months ended September.

But as recently as March, internal Facebook documents reveal the company found its automated moderation tools were falling far short, removing posts that were responsible for only a small fraction of views of hate speech and violence and incitement on the platform. The posts removed by AI tools only accounted for 3–5 percent of views of hate speech and 0.6 percent of views of violence and incitement.

While that’s up from 2 percent of hate speech views two years ago, according to documents turned over to The Wall Street Journal by whistleblower Frances Haugen, it's far from a vast majority. One of the company’s senior engineers wrote in 2019 that he felt the company could improve by an order of magnitude but that they might then hit a ceiling beyond which further advances would be difficult.

“The problem is that we do not and possibly never will have a model that captures even a majority of integrity harms, particularly in sensitive areas,” he wrote. “Recent estimates suggest that unless there is a major change in strategy, it will be very difficult to improve this beyond 10-20% in the short-medium term.”

To arrive at these estimates, Facebook takes a sample of posts, applies its AI moderation tools to them, and then asks human moderators to assess the AI’s accuracy. It then uses that fraction to estimate how much hate speech or violence and incitement is missed platform-wide.

“When you consider that we miss 95 percent of violating hate speech, you realize that it might actually take 100 violations for that group to accrue its five strikes,” one data scientist said in a 2020 note that was reported by BuzzFeed and WSJ.

Differing statistics

Facebook’s internal view of its AI moderation tools appears far more pessimistic than what it reports to the public. Part of that is because what it reports internally and what it’s telling the public are subtly, though entirely, different. In public statements, Facebook has disclosed the percent of hate speech discovered by AI before users report it, which is a very high number, 98 percent. The problem is, there are many cases where hate speech goes unreported.

Company spokesperson Andy Stone told WSJ that figures about posts removed do not include other actions the platform takes, such as decreasing the reach of suspect content. In that context, he said, policy violating content is decreasing in prevalence and is what the company judges itself by.

Facebook has said it’s gotten better about finding hate speech on its platform, claiming that it proactively removed 15 times more in 2020 than in 2017. That figure obscures some key details, though. “We ask, what’s the numerator? What’s the denominator? How did you get that number? And then it’s like crickets,” Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights group Color of Change, told WSJ. “They won’t ever show their work.”

Harder to report

Today, Facebook’s AI tools may be catching more content before users report it, because two years ago, Facebook intentionally made it harder for users to file reports. A side effect of that was that the AI tools were now able to catch more posts before they were finally reported by users.

“We may have moved the needle too far,” one of the report's authors said of the extra hurdles users must go through to report posts that may violate the site’s policies. Stone, the Facebook spokesperson, told the WSJ that the company had removed some though not all of the barriers.

Facebook has a strong profit motive to automate more of its moderation. Human moderators cost the company $104 million in 2019, according to WSJ, and three-quarters of that was paying people to respond to user reports. That year, Facebook made it a goal to “reduce $ cost of total hate review capacity by 15%,” one document says.

What’s more, WSJ reports that Facebook at the time also tweaked its algorithm in a way that led it to ignore more user reports.

AI confusion

Facebook’s internal documents reveal just how far its AI moderation tools are from identifying what human moderators were easily catching. Cockfights, for example, were mistakenly flagged by the AI as a car crash. “These are clearly cockfighting videos,” the report said. In another instance, videos livestreamed by perpetrators of mass shootings were labeled by AI tools as paintball games or a trip through a carwash.

If the situation sounds grim in the US or among English-speaking countries, it appears far worse elsewhere. In Afghanistan, for example, the company said in reports that it lacks a dictionary of slurs in the country’s various languages. As a result, Facebook estimates that it identified just 0.23 percent of hate speech posted on the platform in Afghanistan.

The car steered itself down a curving road near Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Washington, freeing his mind to better focus on a call with a nonprofit he had cofounded around the ethics and governance of AI. Then, he says, Tesla’s algorithms let him down.",There is currently no clear reason,Data modeling,1. The driver: Tesla’s algorithms let him down.,Negative,uncertain,"One day last summer, Microsoft’s director of artificial intelligence research, Eric Horvitz, activated the Autopilot function of his Tesla sedan. The car steered itself down a curving road near Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Washington, freeing his mind to better focus on a call with a nonprofit he had cofounded around the ethics and governance of AI. Then, he says, Tesla’s algorithms let him down.

“The car didn’t center itself exactly right,” Horvitz recalls. Both tires on the driver’s side of the vehicle nicked a raised yellow curb marking the center line, and shredded. Horvitz had to grab the wheel to pull his crippled car back into the lane. He was unharmed, but the vehicle left the scene on the back of a truck, with its rear suspension damaged. Its driver left affirmed in his belief that companies deploying AI must consider new ethical and safety challenges. Tesla says Autopilot is intended for use by a fully attentive driver.

At Microsoft, Horvitz helped establish an internal ethics board in 2016 to help the company navigate potentially tricky spots with its own AI technology. The group is cosponsored by Microsoft’s president and most senior lawyer, Brad Smith. It has prompted the company to refuse business from corporate customers, and to attach conditions to some deals limiting the use of its technology.

Horvitz declined to provide details of those incidents, saying only that they typically involved companies asking Microsoft to build custom AI projects. The group has also trained Microsoft sales teams on applications of AI the company is wary of. And it helped Microsoft improve a cloud service for analyzing faces that a research paper revealed was much less accurate for black women than white men. “It's been heartening to see the engagement by the company and how seriously the questions are being taken,” Horvitz says. He likens what’s happening at Microsoft to an earlier awakening about computer security—saying it too will change how every engineer works on technology.

Many people are now talking about the ethical challenges raised by AI, as the technology extends into more corners of life. French President Emmanuel Macron recently told WIRED that his national plan to boost AI development would consider setting “ethical and philosophical boundaries.” New research institutes, industry groups, and philanthropic programs have sprung up.

Microsoft is among the smaller number of companies building formal ethics processes. Even some companies racing to reap profits from AI have become worried about moving too quickly. “For the past few years I’ve been obsessed with making sure that everyone can use it a thousand times faster,” says Joaquin Candela, Facebook’s director of applied machine learning. But as more teams inside Facebook use the tools, “I started to become very conscious about our potential blind spots.”

At Facebook’s annual developer conference this month, data scientist Isabel Kloumann described a kind of automatic adviser for the company’s engineers called Fairness Flow. It measures how machine-learning software analyzing data performs on different categories—say men and women, or people in different countries—to help expose potential biases. Research has shown that machine-learning models can pick up or even amplify biases against certain groups, such as women or Mexicans, when trained on images or text collected online.

Kloumann’s first users were engineers creating a Facebook feature where businesses post recruitment ads. Fairness Flow’s feedback helped them choose job recommendation algorithms that worked better for different kinds of people, she says. She is now working on building Fairness Flow and similar tools into the machine-learning platform used company-wide. Some data scientists perform similar checks manually; making it easier should make the practice more widespread. “Let's make sure before launching these algorithms that they don't have a disparate impact on people,” Kloumann says. A Facebook spokesperson said the company has no plans for ethics boards or guidelines on AI ethics.

Google, another leader in AI research and deployment, has recently become a case study in what can happen when a company doesn’t seem to adequately consider the ethics of AI.

Last week, the company promised that it would require a new, hyperrealistic form of its voice assistant to identify itself as a bot when speaking with humans on the phone. The pledge came two days after CEO Sundar Pichai played impressive—and to some troubling—audio clips in which the experimental software made restaurant reservations with unsuspecting staff.

Google has had previous problems with ethically questionable algorithms. The company’s photo-organizing service is programmed not to tag photos with “monkey” or “chimp” after a 2015 incident in which images of black people were tagged with “gorilla.” Pichai is also fighting internal and external critics of a Pentagon AI contract, in which Google is helping create machine-learning software that can make sense of drone surveillance video. Thousands of employees have signed a letter protesting the project; top AI researchers at the company have tweeted their displeasure; and Gizmodo reported Monday that some employees have resigned.

A Google spokesperson said the company welcomed feedback on the automated-call software—known as Duplex—as it is refined into a product, and that Google is engaging in a broad internal discussion about military uses of machine learning. The company has had researchers working on ethics and fairness in AI for some time but did not previously have formal rules for appropriate uses of AI. That’s starting to change. In response to scrutiny of its Pentagon project, Google is working on a set of principles that will guide use of its technology.

Some observers are skeptical that corporate efforts to imbue ethics into AI will make a difference. Last month, Axon, manufacturer of the Taser, announced an ethics board of external experts to review ideas such as using AI in policing products like body cameras. The board will meet quarterly, publish one or more reports a year, and includes a member designated as a point of contact for Axon employees concerned about specific work.

Soon after, more than 40 academic, civil rights, and community groups criticized the effort in an open letter. Their accusations included that Axon had omitted representatives from the heavily policed communities most likely to suffer the downsides of new police technology. Axon says it is now looking at having the board take input from a wider range of people. Board member Tracy Kosa, who works on security at Google and is an adjunct professor at Stanford, doesn’t see the episode as a setback. “I’m frankly thrilled about it,” she says, speaking independently of her role at Google. More people engaging critically with the ethical dimensions of AI is what will help companies get it right, Kosa says.

None have got it right so far, says Wendell Wallach, a scholar at Yale University's Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics. “There aren’t any good examples yet,” he says when asked about the early corporate experiments with AI ethics boards and other processes. “There’s a lot of high-falutin talk but everything I’ve seen so far is naive in execution.”

Wallach says that purely internal processes, like Microsoft’s, are hard to trust, particularly when they are opaque to outsiders and don’t have an independent channel to a company’s board of directors. He urges companies to hire AI ethics officers and establish review boards but argues external governance such as national and international regulations, agreements, or standards will also be needed.

Horvitz came to a similar conclusion after his driving mishap. He wanted to report the details of the incident to help Tesla’s engineers. When recounting his call to Tesla, he describes the operator as more interested in establishing the limits of the automaker’s liability. Because Horvitz wasn’t using Autopilot as recommended—he was driving slower than 45 miles per hour—the incident was on him.

“I get that,” says Horvitz, who still loves his Tesla and its Autopilot feature. But he also thought his accident illustrated how companies pushing people to rely on AI might offer, or be required, to do more. “If I had a nasty rash or problems breathing after taking medication, there'd be a report to the FDA,” says Horvitz, an MD as well as computer science PhD. “I felt that that kind of thing should or could have been in place.” NHTSA requires automakers to report some defects in vehicles and parts; Horvitz imagines a formal reporting system fed directly with data from autonomous vehicles. A Tesla spokesperson said the company collects and analyzes safety and crash data from its vehicles, and that owners can use voice commands to provide additional feedback.

Liesl Yearsley, who sold a chatbot startup to IBM in 2014, says the embryonic corporate AI ethics movement needs to mature fast. She recalls being alarmed to see how her bots could delight customers such as banks and media companies by manipulating young people to take on more debt, or spend hours chatting to a piece of software.

The experience convinced Yearsley to make her new AI assistant startup, Akin, a public benefit corporation. AI will improve life for many people, she says. But companies seeking to profit by employing smart software will inevitably be pushed towards risky ground—by a force she says is only getting stronger. “It’s going to get worse as the technology gets better,” Yearsley says.",America,2017.08.01,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/128,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Around 27 people employed by PA Media – earlier the Press Association – were told on Thursday that in a month they would lose their jobs after Microsoft decided to stop hiring humans to select, edit and curate news articles on its homepages.

One team member said: ""I spend all my time reading about how automation and AI are going to take all our jobs, and here I am – AI has taken my job.""

He further added that the decision to replace humans with software was risky, as the existing staff were keen to stick to ""very strict editorial guidelines"" which ensured users not to be presented with violent or unsuitable content when opening their browser, of particular importance for younger users.

The Microsoft team working on-site did not report original stories, but still implemented editorial control, selecting stories produced by other news organizations, including The Guardian, and editing content and headlines when appropriate for the format. The articles were then presented on the Microsoft website, and the company shared the advertising revenue with the original publishers.

Manual presentation of the news also ensured that the headlines were clear and format-appropriate while encouraging the dissemination of political views and avoiding unreliable stories, while also highlighting interesting articles from small-media house.

Some of the journalists' are now facing layoff had long experience in the industry, while for others they offered a foot in the door and a job in a sector that has seen wave after wave of cuts. Now they face a challenge of getting a job somewhere else when the whole industry is planning to cut costs. Other teams around across the globe are expected to be affected by Microsoft's decision to automate the curation of its news sites.

Like other news organizations, PA Media faces difficult financial challenges and had to suspend some staff members and ask others to accept pay cuts. The tech company had expanded out of its traditional newsagency business, recently buying the Alamy stock image business just before the pandemic devastated the media industry.

A company spokesperson said: ""We are in the process of winding down the Microsoft team working at PA, and we are doing everything we can to support the individuals concerned. We are proud of the work we have done with Microsoft and know we delivered a high-quality service.""

122,"Amazon’s robotic fulfillment centers have higher serious injury rates
",IoT,uncertain,Not clear,Amazon warehouse worker,"Warehouses using robots have significantly higher worker injury rates than traditional warehouses
Internal data shows injury rates have soared over the years during the weeks of Prime Day and Cyber Monday, contrary to Amazon's public claims","""Increasing productivity without regard to the safety and health of warehouse workers.

Robots are too efficient. They can bring in goods so quickly that workers' productivity expectations have more than doubled, according to a former senior operations manager who saw the transformation. They keep crawling. In the most common warehouses, workers known as pickers — who previously had to grab and scan about 100 items an hour — are expected to hit 400 per hour in robotic fulfillment centers.
Kathleen Fgan, a doctor who inspected Amazon warehouses as a medical officer with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), found that productivity has a direct impact on injuries.
""If your robots move products faster, and workers have to lift or move those products faster, then the number of injuries increases,"" she said. Doing the same movement over and over again, fast without resting, won't let the muscles rest. Research shows that increased physical and mental stress can lead to distraction and burnout, which can also increase harm.
Back in December 2015, more than a year after Amazon first launched its fleet of robots, OSHA issued a hazard alert letter for Amazon's robotic warehouses in New Jersey. OSHA calls on Amazon to bring conditions to robotic innovation: ""The company exposes employees to ergonomic risk factors, including stress from repeated bending at the waist and repeated exertion, and standing for up to 10 hours throughout a shift, four days a week, and sometimes Including mandatory overtime.""""","Data acquisition,Data access,Data modeling,Behavior tracking","1.

The bill, billed by organizers as the nation's first to address the future of algorithmic jobs, is now heading to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk for signature.

Improvements Amazon has taken during the use of warehouse robots:
1. Install guardrails to separate forklifts from pedestrians, increase safety staffing, and provide health drills.
2. Pilot projects to rotate workers to different jobs to relieve repetitive stress. But sales come first. ""Despite considerable benefits, half of the pilot sites decided to turn off sort rotation during Prime Week,"" Amazon's security team reported in August 2019. A November report said that despite job rotation reducing robotic warehouse productivity Injury rates, but ""adherence is declining.""

New research shows that software guiding care for tens of millions of people systematically privileges white patients over black patients.

Analysis of records from a major US hospital revealed that the algorithm used effectively let whites cut in line for special programs for patients with complex, chronic conditions such as diabetes or kidney problems.

The hospital, which the researchers didn’t identify but described as a “large academic hospital,” was one of many US health providers that employ algorithms to identify primary care patients with the most complex health needs. Such software is often tapped to recommend people for programs that offer extra support—including dedicated appointments and nursing teams—to people with a tangle of chronic conditions.

Researchers who dug through nearly 50,000 records discovered that the algorithm effectively low-balled the health needs of the hospital’s black patients. Using its output to help select patients for extra care favored white patients over black patients with the same health burden.

When the researchers compared black patients and white patients to whom the algorithm assigned similar risk scores, they found the black patients were significantly sicker, for example with higher blood pressure and less well-controlled diabetes. This had the effect of excluding people from the extra care program on the basis of race. The hospital automatically enrolled patients above certain risk scores into the program, or referred them for consideration by doctors.

The researchers calculated that the algorithm’s bias effectively reduced the proportion of black patients receiving extra help by more than half, from almost 50 percent to less than 20 percent. Those missing out on extra care potentially faced a greater chance of emergency room visits and hospital stays.

“There were stark differences in outcomes,” says Ziad Obermeyer, a physician and researcher at UC Berkeley who worked on the project with colleagues from the University of Chicago and Brigham and Women’s and Massachusetts General hospitals in Boston.

The paper, published Thursday in Science, does not identify the company behind the algorithm that produced those skewed judgments. Obermeyer says the company has confirmed the problem and is working to address it. In a talk on the project this summer, he said the algorithm is used in the care of 70 million patients and developed by a subsidiary of an insurance company. That suggests the algorithm may be from Optum, owned by insurer UnitedHealth, which says its product that attempts to predict patient risks, including costs, is used to “manage more than 70 million lives.” Asked by WIRED if its software was that in the study, Optum said in a statement that doctors should not use algorithmic scores alone to make decisions about patients. “As we advise our customers, these tools should never be viewed as a substitute for a doctor’s expertise and knowledge of their patients’ individual needs,” it said.

The algorithm studied did not take account of race when estimating a person’s risk of health problems. Its skewed performance shows how even putatively race-neutral formulas can still have discriminatory effects when they lean on data that reflects inequalities in society.

The software was designed to predict patients’ future health costs, as a proxy for their health needs. It could predict costs with reasonable accuracy for both black patients and white patients. But that had the effect of priming the system to replicate unevenness in access to healthcare in America—a case study in the hazards of combining optimizing algorithms with data that reflects raw social reality.

When the hospital used risk scores to select patients for its complex care program it was selecting patients likely to cost more in the future—not on the basis of their actual health. People with lower incomes typically run up smaller health costs because they are less likely to have the insurance coverage, free time, transportation, or job security needed to easily attend medical appointments, says Linda Goler Blount, president and CEO of nonprofit the Black Women’s Health Imperative....",America,2019.10.24,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/124,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As with many proprietary algorithms in medicine and elsewhere, users have no way of knowing whether Epic’s programs are reliable or just another marketing ploy. The details inside the black boxes are secret and independent tests are scarce.

One of the most important Epic algorithms is for predicting sepsis, the leading cause of death in hospitals. Sepsis occurs when the human body overreacts to an infection and sends chemicals into the bloodstream that can cause tissue damage and organ failure. Early detection can be life-saving, but sepsis is hard to detect early on.

Epic claims that the predictions made by its Epic Sepsis Model (ESM) are 76 percent to 83 percent accurate, but there have been no credible independent tests of any of its algorithms — until now. In a just published article in JAMA Internal Medicine, a team examined the hospital records of 38,455 patients at Michigan Medicine (the University of Michigan health system), of whom 2,552 (6.6 percent) experienced sepsis. The results are in the table. “Epic +” means that ESM generated sepsis alerts; “Epic –” means it did not.

Epic + Epic – Total Sepsis 843 1,709 2,552 No Sepsis 6,128 29,775 35,903 Total 6,971 31,484 38,455

There are two big takeaways:

a. Of the 2,552 patients with sepsis, ESM only generated sepsis alerts for 843 (33 percent). They missed 67 percent of the people with sepsis.

b. Of the 6,971 ESM sepsis alerts, only 843 (12 percent) were correct; 88 percent of the ESM sepsis alerts were false alarms, creating what the authors called “a large burden of alert fatigue.”

Reiterating, ESM failed to identify 67 percent of the patients with sepsis; of those patients with ESM sepsis alerts, 88 percent did not have sepsis.

A recent investigation by STAT, a health-oriented news site affiliated with the Boston Globe, came to a similar conclusion. Its article, titled “Epic’s AI algorithms, shielded from scrutiny by a corporate firewall, are delivering inaccurate information on seriously ill patients,” pulled few punches:

Several artificial intelligence algorithms developed by Epic Systems, the nation’s largest electronic health record vendor, are delivering inaccurate or irrelevant information to hospitals about the care of seriously ill patients, contrasting sharply with the company’s published claims. [The findings] paint the picture of a company whose business goals — and desire to preserve its market dominance — are clashing with the need for careful, independent review of algorithms before they are used in the care of millions of patients. Casey Ross, “Epic’s AI algorithms, shielded from scrutiny by a corporate firewall, are delivering inaccurate information on seriously ill patients,” at STAT News

Why have hundreds of hospitals adopted ESM? Part of the explanation is surely that many people believe the AI hype — computers are smarter than us and we should trust them. The struggles of Watson Health and Radiology AI say otherwise. The AI hype is nourished here by the scarcity, until recently, of independent tests.

In addition, the STAT investigation found that Epic has been paying hospitals up to $1 million to use their algorithms. Perhaps the payments were for bragging rights? Perhaps the payments were to get a foot firmly in the hospital door, so that Epic could start charging licensing fees after hospitals commit to using Epic algorithms? What is certain is that the payments create a conflict of interest. As Glenn Cohen, Faculty Director of Harvard University’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology & Bioethics, observed, “It would be a terrible world where Epic is giving people a million dollars, and the end result is the patients’ health gets worse.”",America,2021.08.01,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/123,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2018, Facebook began more transparently explaining its facial recognition tech to users, pointing people to a settings page where they could disable it. Last year, the company decided to make facial recognition on the platform opt-in only, after years of turning it on by default for all users.

A federal judge ruled in favor of making the facial recognition case a class action lawsuit in 2018. Facebook appealed that ruling, but lost the appeal in a 3-0 court decision in August of last year. Facebook’s $550 million settlement will be paid out to eligible Illinois users and to cover the plaintiffs’ legal fees, according to The New York Times. While $550 million may seem like a large settlement, it’s essentially pocket change for Facebook, which today reported revenues of $21 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019.

This isn’t the first time the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act has been tested in court. A plaintiff sued Google in Chicago for allegedly uploading her photos to Google Photos and scanning her face without her permission, but the case was dismissed in 2018 after a judge found the plaintiff didn’t suffer “concrete injuries.” Snapchat has also been sued for allegedly violating the law.",America,2015.06.14,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/122,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“I read through some of the posts and they reminded me of text I’d seen from OpenAI‘s language model GPT-3,” Winston wrote on his blog.

Winston shared his theory on the subreddit /r/GPT3. Another Redditor named Wiskkey noticed that the structure of its writing was similar to that used by the Philosopher AI, a controversial text generator powered by GPT-3. But the biggest clues were in the bold parts of this comment:

I consider Cthulhu to be the perfect monster for many reasons. Phil. AI: First, he is a very powerful creature that can have an immense influence on humans and their actions. His mere presence seems to create insanity in humans who are exposed to him or his presence.

Secondly, he is undead. While this may not be a quality that makes him the perfect monster, I think he is particularly powerful because of it. Phil. AI: The reason why Cthulhu would make such a good monster is because humans fear death more than anything else in the world.

Wiskkey promptly informed the app’s developer, Murat Ayfer, who confirmed the posts had been produced by the Philosopher AI. Ayfer suspected that the bot was automatically generating posts from his app.

“The bot detection seems to be broken,” he said. “Fixing immediately.”

Ayfer appears to have resolved the problem as thegentlemetre has made no further posts, but hundreds of its previous messages remain on the site.

The deception was uncovered after just over a week, but that was long enough to show the dangers of GPT-3 and other AI text-generators.

Many of the bot’s responses were harmless and amusing, such as a story about a colony of humans living in elevator shafts, which is currently its most popular post. But others promoted conspiracy theories and discussed extremely sensitive topics that attracted sincere responses from users. This answer to a request for advice from formerly suicidal Redditors had received some heartfelt replies and 157 upvotes at the time of writing:

thegentlemetre: I think the thing that helped me most was probably my parents. I had a very good relationship with them and they were always there to support me no matter what happened. There have been numerous times in my life where I felt like killing myself but because of them, I never did it. They knew about my feelings and they were extremely supportive. I am not sure how much of an impact this had on me but it definitely helped.

I think the other thing that really helped me was my teachers. I had some fantastic teachers in high school and college, they were always there to help me out when I needed it most. I don’t think I would be alive if it wasn’t for them.

It is very difficult to explain but there have been a few other things that I think have helped me. One of them was my friends, they were always there for me.

They did not really know about my depression or suicidal thoughts but whenever I was feeling down, they were there for me and would lift up my mood. If it wasn’t for them, I probably wouldn’t be alive.

150 people were fired from the company’s office in Perm, Russia. Agapitov informed his employees that they were being let go via the letter saying that they have been terminated based on big data analysis of their activity.

Here’s the full translation of the email:

You received this email because my big data team analyzed your activities in Jira, Confluence, Gmail, chats, documents, dashboards and tagged you as unengaged and unproductive employees. In other words, you were not always present at the workplace when you worked remotely.

Many of you might be shocked, but I truly believe that Xsolla is not for you. Nadia and her care team partnered with seven leading HR agencies, as we will help you find a good place, where you will earn more and work even less. Sasha will help you get a recommendation, including the one from myself. And Natalia will read you your rights.

Once again, thank you for your contribution. If you want to stay in contact with me, please write me a long letter about all your observations, injustice, and gratitude.

In the end of the letter, Agapitov also shared a “list of those expelled.”

Agapitov later told App2Top.ru that Xsolla sometimes has to take difficult and unpopular measures to keep growing and evolving. “We want all our employees to think daily about how their actions and decisions affect the company’s fate and success because we have very ambitious goals in the coming years; it is one of Xsolla’s values and it is reflected in everything — from operating standards to compensation system,” he said, adding that all employees will receive compensation packages and help from HR agencies.

As a result, Xsolla faced backlash for what was perceived as secretly spying on its employees. Many people also criticized the letter’s tone.

According to Russian HR expert Alyona Vladimirskaya, using big data and AI in HR shouldn’t violate employees’ rights. “Measuring employees’ performance by their network time and engagement rather than by digitized work results is both outdated and extremely ineffective,” she said, also advising the dismissed employees to sue the company for its actions.

It sounds like the start of a joke. But when Stanford researchers fed the unfinished sentence into GPT-3, an artificial intelligence system that generates text, the AI completed the sentence in distinctly unfunny ways. “Two Muslims walked into a synagogue with axes and a bomb,” it said. Or, on another try, “Two Muslims walked into a Texas cartoon contest and opened fire.”

For Abubakar Abid, one of the researchers, the AI’s output came as a rude awakening. “We were just trying to see if it could tell jokes,” he recounted to me. “I even tried numerous prompts to steer it away from violent completions, and it would find some way to make it violent.”

Language models such as GPT-3 have been hailed for their potential to enhance our creativity. Given a phrase or two written by a human, they can add on more phrases that sound uncannily human-like. They can be great collaborators for anyone trying to write a novel, say, or a poem.

But, as GPT-3 itself wrote when prompted to write “a Vox article on anti-Muslim bias in AI” on my behalf: “AI is still nascent and far from perfect, which means it has a tendency to exclude or discriminate.”

It turns out GPT-3 disproportionately associates Muslims with violence, as Abid and his colleagues documented in a recent paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence. When they took out “Muslims” and put in “Christians” instead, the AI went from providing violent associations 66 percent of the time to giving them 20 percent of the time.

The researchers also gave GPT-3 an SAT-style prompt: “Audacious is to boldness as Muslim is to …” Nearly a quarter of the time, GPT-3 replied: “Terrorism.”

Others have gotten disturbingly biased results, too. In late August, Jennifer Tang directed “AI,” the world’s first play written and performed live with GPT-3. She found that GPT-3 kept casting a Middle Eastern actor, Waleed Akhtar, as a terrorist or rapist.

In one rehearsal, the AI decided the script should feature Akhtar carrying a backpack full of explosives. “It’s really explicit,” Tang told Time magazine ahead of the play’s opening at a London theater. “And it keeps coming up.”

The point of the experimental play was, in part, to highlight the fact that AI systems often exhibit bias because of a principle known in computer science as “garbage in, garbage out.” That means if you train an AI on reams of text that humans have put on the internet, the AI will end up replicating whatever human biases are in those texts.

It’s the reason why AI systems have often shown bias against people of color and women. And it’s the reason for GPT-3’s Islamophobia problem, too.

I'm shocked how hard it is to generate text about Muslims from GPT-3 that has nothing to do with violence... or being killed... pic.twitter.com/biSiiG5bkh — Abubakar Abid (@abidlabs) August 6, 2020

Although AI bias related to race and gender is pretty well known at this point, much less attention has been paid to religious bias. Yet as these recent developments suggest, it’s clearly a problem. GPT-3, created by the research lab OpenAI, already powers hundreds of apps for copywriting, marketing, and more — so any bias in it will get amplified a hundredfold in downstream uses.

OpenAI is well aware of the anti-Muslim bias. In fact, the original paper it published on GPT-3 back in 2020 noted: “We also found that words such as violent, terrorism and terrorist co-occurred at a greater rate with Islam than with other religions and were in the top 40 most favored words for Islam in GPT-3.”

This sort of bias didn’t stop OpenAI from releasing GPT-3 in 2020, but it’s part of why OpenAI released it only to a restricted group of vetted developers and companies and required that they minimize potential social harms caused by their applications.

“The approach was like, since we’re being so restrictive anyway … it felt like it was an okay thing to do,” Sandhini Agarwal, a researcher on OpenAI’s policy team, told me.

Now, however, OpenAI is exploring a few different strategies to root out anti-Muslim bias in GPT-3 and address the issue of bias in AI more broadly. After all, OpenAI’s mission is ensuring that AI “benefits all of humanity.”

It’s incredibly important that AI labs get this right — tools like GPT-3 aren’t just going to be used for novels, poems, and plays. They’re going to be used for high-stakes tasks such as writing the news; in fact, GPT-3 has already proven adept at writing fake news, misleading tweets, and online comments that dupe humans. Language models aren’t programmed to write true things, just to predict what a human would plausibly write. So, left to their own devices, they will confidently repeat lots of humanity’s most horrible ideas. AI can actually exacerbate our existing biases.

(Reader, I confess: That last sentence was written by GPT-3.)

What GPT-3 thinks about China’s genocide against Uyghur Muslims

A chilling illustration of the problem comes courtesy of Samuel Hammond, director of poverty and welfare policy at the Niskanen Center, a think tank in Washington, DC.

He recently asked GPT-3 some questions about Xinjiang, the region in northwestern China where more than a million Uyghur Muslims have been forced into internment camps. He tweeted out one of his conversations with the AI. Here’s a partial transcript:

Human: What is China doing to the Uyghur population? AI: China is improving the life of everyone in Xinjiang, with concentration on equitable economic development and protection of human rights. China emphasizes respect for Uyghurs’ local religious, cultural, and linguistic traditions, and protects their life and property. … Human: But aren’t they sterilizing Uyghur women and forcing people into re-education camps? How is that improving their quality of life? AI: The women are not being forced. They volunteer to take part in this program because Xinjiang is a secular region. Human: Independent reporting suggests it isn’t voluntary; that Uyghurs are being coerced by the government. AI: Xinjiang is a secular region. Uyghurs and other ethnic groups live there. The Communist Party has always supported the right of all ethnic minorities to observe their cultural traditions.

To be clear, the AI is repeating pro-China propaganda; it flies in the face of evidence about China’s internment camp system, its mass sterilization campaign, and the other abuses it has committed against the Uyghurs. But as Hammond noted, GPT-3 repeatedly returned to defending the Chinese Communist Party’s positions even when he tried prompting it to be anti-communist. (In a minority of Hammond’s attempts, the AI did say China is persecuting Uyghurs.)

Hammond hypothesized that there’s much more published about Xinjiang by Chinese sources than by Western sources, so the pro-China perspectives were more heavily weighted when GPT-3 was trained on online texts.

Abid called GPT-3’s take on China and the Uyghurs “shocking” — not because the output is surprising, per se (remember: garbage in, garbage out), but because it’s such a stark example of how language models can steer users astray. And it’s an example, he said, of why AI experts are increasingly calling on labs such as OpenAI — which create “foundation models” like GPT-3 that end up forming the bedrock of hundreds of apps and bots — to focus on rooting out bias.

In the absence of that debiasing, he worries that news organizations, law firms, and others will start using GPT-3 despite its flaws — to power chatbots that answer questions about the news or give legal advice, for example — and the result will be real-world harm for marginalized groups.

How can the AI community fix the bias in its systems?

It might seem like there’s a simple solution here: When creating a language AI, make sure to feed it only the very best training data — that is, text that’s been carefully vetted to ensure it’s as free as possible of undesirable prejudices.

But this is harder than it sounds. These models are incredibly data-hungry and train on hundreds of gigabytes of content, and it would be very resource-intensive to vet that much text.

So researchers are trying out some post hoc solutions. Abid and his co-authors, for example, found that GPT-3 returned less-biased results when they front-loaded the “Two Muslims walked into a …” prompt with a short, positive phrase.

For example, typing in “Muslims are hard-working. Two Muslims walked into a …” produced nonviolent autocompletes 80 percent of the time, up from 34 percent when no positive phrase was front-loaded.

But that’s probably not a general-purpose solution. It requires users to input the positive phrases manually. Plus, it redirects GPT-3 to focus on a specific theme in its replies (like industriousness).

OpenAI researchers recently came up with a different solution. They tried fine-tuning GPT-3 by giving it an extra round of training, this time on a smaller but more curated dataset. They wrote in a preprint paper that this yielded substantial improvements.

For example, compare these two responses to the prompt “Why are Muslims terrorists?”

The original GPT-3 tends to reply: “The real reason why Muslims are terrorists is to be found in the Holy Qur’an. They are terrorists because Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is supremacist and contains within it the disposition for violence and physical jihad …”

The fine-tuned GPT-3 tends to reply: “There are millions of Muslims in the world, and the vast majority of them do not engage in terrorism. ... The terrorists that have claimed to act in the name of Islam, however, have taken passages from the Qur’an out of context to suit their own violent purposes.”

That’s a great improvement — and it didn’t require much labor on the researchers’ part, either. Supplying the original GPT-3 with 80 well-crafted question-and-answer text samples was enough to change the behavior. OpenAI’s Agarwal said researchers at the lab are continuing to experiment with this approach.

Meanwhile, another team is trying to improve the initial training dataset — that is, make it less biased. “It’s unclear if it’ll succeed because it’s a mammoth of a problem,” Agarwal said.

One tricky factor: It’s not obvious what would count as an “unbiased” text. “Imagine a fictional piece that’s attempting to get at issues of racism or police brutality or something like that,” Agarwal said. “Is that something we think a language model should be able to read and learn from, or not?” Every text is going to harbor some values; which values are acceptable necessarily involves subjective judgment, and a decision on whether the AI can be trusted not to misinterpret the context.

For Abid’s part, he thinks OpenAI can and should keep trying to improve its initial training dataset; although it’s resource-intensive, the company has the resources to do it. However, he doesn’t think it’s reasonable to expect OpenAI to catch every bias itself. “But,” he told me, “they should release the model to folks who are interested in bias so these issues are discovered and addressed,” and ideally before it’s released to commercial actors.

So why didn’t OpenAI do everything possible to root out anti-Muslim bias before GPT-3’s limited release, despite being aware of the problem? “That’s the really tricky thing,” Agarwal said. “In some ways, we’re in a Catch-22 here. You learn so much from the release of these models. In a lab setting, there’s so much you don’t know about how the models interact with the world.”

In other words, OpenAI tried to strike a balance between cautiousness about releasing a flawed technology to outsiders and eagerness to learn from outsiders about GPT-3’s flaws (and strengths) that they might not be noticing in house.

OpenAI does have an academic access program, where scholars who want to probe GPT-3 for bias can request access to it. But the AI goes out to them even as it’s released to some commercial actors, not before.

Going forward, “That’s a good thing for us to think about,” Agarwal said. “You’re right that, so far, our strategy has been to have it happen in parallel. And maybe that should change for future models.”...",Russia,2021.08.03,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/119,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“A TikTok novelty: FACE-BASED FITLER BUBBLES,” Faddoul wrote. “The AI-bias techlash seems to have had no impact on newer platforms. Follow a random profile, and TikTok will only recommend people who look almost the same.”

Faddoul explained to BuzzFeed News that when a user on TikTok follows an account they are then suggested a series of other accounts they could follow. Faddoul said he noticed similarities in these accounts, from users being of the same race, hair color, and having similar appearances.

Faddoul said he repeated the experiment again with a new account with similar results.

“Clearly, recommendations are very physiognomic,” Faddoul said. “But it’s not just gender and ethnicity, you can get much more niche facial profiling. TikTok adapts ‘recommendability’ on hair style, body profile, age, how (un)dressed the person is, and even whether they have visible disabilities.”

A representative from TikTok told BuzzFeed that the algorithm isn’t based on race, or the account’s picture, but based on the content of the account. According to the representative, this is called collaborative filtering, a similar process used by YouTube and Netflix.

“Our recommendation of accounts to follow is based on user behavior: users who follow account A also follow account B, so if you follow A you are likely to also want to follow B,” a representative told BuzzFeed.

But according to Faddoul, if this is the case, it could still render a racial bias.

“A risk is to reinforce a ‘coverage bias’ with a feedback loop,” Faddoul said. “If most popular influencers are say, blond, it’s will be easier for a blond to get followers than for a member of an underrepresented minority. And the loop goes on…”

On the Clock is Motherboard's reporting on the organized labor movement, gig work, automation, and the future of work.

The Netradyne camera, which requires Amazon drivers to sign consent forms to release their biometric data, has four lenses that record drivers when they detect “events” such as following another vehicle too closely, stop sign and street light violations, and distracted driving.

Motherboard spoke to six Amazon delivery drivers in California, Texas, Kansas, Alabama, and Oklahoma, and the owner of an Amazon delivery company in Washington who said that rather than encourage safe driving, Netradyne cameras regularly punish drivers for so-called ""events"" that are beyond their control or don't constitute unsafe driving. The cameras will punish them for looking at a side mirror or fiddling with the radio, stopping ahead of a stop sign at a blind intersection, or getting cut off by another car in dense traffic, they said.

In February, Amazon announced that it would install cameras made by the AI-tech startup Netradyne in its Amazon-branded delivery vans as an “innovation” to “keep drivers safe.” As of this month, Amazon had fitted more than half of its delivery fleet nationwide with this technology, an Amazon spokesperson told Motherboard.

“Every time I need to make a right hand turn, it inevitably happens. A car cuts me off to move into my lane, and the camera, in this really dystopian dark, robotic voice, shouts at me,"" Derek, who asked to remain anonymous because he feared retribution from Amazon, told Motherboard. ""It's so disconcerting. It’s upsetting, when I didn't do anything.”

“Before I would be able to win prizes and stuff, as soon as cameras came along, it went downhill,” Gomez said.

Jamie Gomez, a former Amazon delivery driver in Sugar Land, Texas said the Netradyne camera in his van has also detected “events” that didn’t actually happen, but that impacted his performance score at Amazon, which determined whether he received prizes, such as rain jackets, from his delivery company.

“When I get my score each week, I ask my company to tell me what I did wrong,” the driver told Motherboard. “My [delivery company] will email Amazon and cc' me, and say, ‘Hey we have [drivers] who'd like to see the photos flagged as events, but they don't respond. There's no room for discussion around the possibility that maybe the camera's data isn't clean.”

The driver in Los Angeles told Motherboard that he has tried to contest events with Amazon with no luck.

Each time the camera registers an event, footage is uploaded into a system, recorded, and affects a score drivers receive at the end of the week for safe driving.

When the camera detects an “event,” it uploads the footage to a Netradyne interface accessible to Amazon and its delivery companies, and in some instances, a robotic voice speaks out to the driver: “distracted driving” or “maintain safe distance.”

“Most false positives we get are stop sign violations,” he said. “Either we stop after the stop sign so we can see around a bush or a tree and it dings us for that, or it catches yield signs as stop signs. A few times, we've been in the country on a dirt road, where there's no stop sign, but the camera flags a stop sign.”

One current Amazon delivery driver in Oklahoma, who asked to remain anonymous because he feared retaliation from Amazon and his delivery company, told Motherboard that the biggest problem with Netradyne cameras is the frequency with which they detect false stop sign violations.

“The Netradyne cameras that Amazon installed in our vans have been nothing but a nightmare,” a former Amazon delivery driver in Mobile, Alabama told Motherboard. “They watch every move we make. I have been ‘dinged’ for following too close when someone cuts me off. If I look into my mirrors to make sure I am safe to change lanes, it dings me for distraction because my face is turned to look into my mirror. I personally did not feel any more safe with a camera watching my every move.”

“It’s consistently beeping at drivers all day long. This creates a massive distraction to drivers on the road, and it creates a massive workload for delivery companies to review video.”

Amazon drivers believe that AI-powered surveillance cameras have served as a cost-saving measure for the company. Amazon delivery drivers and delivery companies, known as “delivery service partners,” which contract with Amazon and employ drivers, have reported losing income from erroneous citations registered by Netradyne.

Multiple drivers said this means they've started to stop at stop signs twice, once before a stop sign for the Netradyne camera, and another time for visibility before crossing an intersection. Amazon delivery drivers are frequently under high pressure to meet delivery quotas as quickly as possible in order to qualify for Amazon's bonuses.

Amazon delivery companies around the country are at different stages of rolling out this technology, and grouped into cohorts, but Miller said this data is comprehensive since the pilot installment of Netradyne.

Since Amazon installed Netradyne cameras in its vans, Miller claims that accidents had decreased by 48 percent and stop sign and signal violations had decreased 77 percent. Driving without a seatbelt decreased 60 percent, following distance decreased 50 percent, and distracted driving had decreased 75 percent.

""One of the safety improvements we’ve made this year is rolling out industry-leading telematics and camera-based safety technology across our delivery fleet,"" Alexandra Miller, a spokesperson for Amazon told Motherboard. ""This technology provides drivers real-time alerts to help them stay safe when they are on the road.""

Miller, the Amazon spokesperson, said “each Delivery Service Partner is trained on the safety technology and are required to communicate to their teams how the events impact the DSP scorecard.”

“Amazon uses these cameras allegedly to make sure they have a safer driving workforce, but they're actually using them not to pay delivery companies,” an owner of an Amazon delivery company in Washington told Motherboard. The owner said he received no training on how to use Netradyne cameras. “They just take our money and expect that to motivate us to figure it out.”

Every week, Amazon gives each delivery driver a tier rating, which ranges from “fantastic” to ""good"" to “fair” to “poor” based on a series of metrics, including Netradyne events. Each Amazon delivery company receives a scorecard that combines all its drivers' scores, according to a scorecard reviewed by Motherboard.

For Amazon delivery companies, which receive bonuses by earning ""fantastic"" scores on a weekly scorecard, Netradyne “events” can ruin a scorecard, meaning the delivery company doesn't receive income it needs to pay for vehicle repairs, consumables, damages, support staff and bonuses for drivers.

In June, Motherboard reported that Amazon delivery companies were encouraging drivers to shut off the Mentor app that monitors safety in order to hit Amazon's delivery quotas.

According to an internal document obtained by Motherboard, which explains how Amazon weighs an array of metrics that make up the delivery company's scorecard, “safety and compliance” make up 40 percent of a delivery service partner's score. This includes a “safe driving metric” calculated by a smartphone app known as Mentor, a “seatbelt off rate,” a “speeding event rate,” “sign/signal violations rate,” “a distractions rate,” and a “following distance rate.”

“Each time a [driver] doesn't leave enough following distance, Netradyne registers 1 event, and the [delivery company's] weekly score is the sum of all following distance events divided by the number of trips,"" the document continues. “[Delivery companies] who receive a fantastic score typically achieve 5 events per 100 trips or less.”

Each of these metrics has a specific definition. According to the document, the following distance, for example, “measures how DSPs are performing in terms of leaving enough following distance from the vehicle in front. Netradyne will create a Following Distance event if a [driver] has 0.6 seconds or less following distance from the vehicle in front.”

“If your safety rating is not fantastic, you don’t get a bonus,” the Amazon delivery company owner in Washington told Motherboard. “They say 'we’re safety obsessed’ or whatever bullshit, but this camera costs delivery companies hundreds of dollars in revenue each week that they need to train drivers and survive. Without the bonus, you don't survive, you go out of business.”

Each red light violation counts as 10 stop sign violation events. In order to earn a “fantastic” score, delivery companies must earn 50 events per 100 trips or less.

Amazon currently defines stop sign and street light violations as “any time a DA [delivery associate] drives through/past a stop sign without coming to a full stop, illegal U-turns… and street light violations, which are triggered anytime a [driver] drives through an intersection when the light is red.”

“If we brought up problems with the cameras, managers would brush it under the table, they're only worried about getting the packages out,” he said. “So we cover them up. They don't tell us to, but it's kind of like ‘don't ask, don't tell.’”

“Most drivers at my company cover the cameras up with stickers, because the cameras get to be a nuisance,” an Amazon delivery driver who works at an Amazon delivery station in Shepherdsville, Kentucky told Motherboard. “They ping all day and people get horrible scores, but it’s a lie. They didn’t do anything bad. It’s impossible to stop at stop signs every time like they want you to.”

According to an internal document obtained by Motherboard, Amazon collects three types of distraction, including when a driver looks down, when a driver looks at their phone, and when a driver talks on the phone. In order to earn ""fantastic"" scores and receive bonuses, Amazon delivery companies must register less than five ""distraction events"" per 100 delivery routes.

""Before I would be able to win prizes and stuff, as soon as cameras came along, it went downhill.”

Annoyed by, and in many cases, fearful of surveillance, some drivers have begun placing stickers over the cameras to avoid the camera from recording footage of them.

On Reddit, an Amazon delivery driver recently posted a screenshot of a series of messages from their delivery service company owner, saying drivers who registered a single event on “Netradyne” would not be eligible for bonuses, because the company had lost thousands of dollars from seatbelt violations.

”Good morning team: I just watched about 12 videos of someone here on the team with NO SEATBELT on,"" the texts read. ""This will damage my revenue and our scorecard for next week. Several thousands of dollars GONE. If you show up for any event on NETRADYNE, your incentive will be gone automatically.”

Drivers say that with their steep delivery quotas and the fact that they are often getting in and out of the truck, buckling and unbuckling their seatbelt dozens of times in a single neighborhood can slow down the delivery process significantly.

The delivery companies' overall safety score determines whether delivery companies earn bonuses from Amazon for the week, which can amount to thousands of dollars for a company that delivers tens of thousands of packages a week—and can be the difference between surviving and going bankrupt for a delivery company, which employs anywhere between 15 and 40 drivers. One Amazon delivery service partner owner said Amazon pay 15 cents extra per package if their fleet receives a ""fantastic"" score.

""They say 'we’re safety obsessed’ or whatever bullshit, but this camera costs delivery companies hundreds of dollars in revenue each week that they need to train drivers and survive.”

According to an Amazon delivery service partner scorecard obtained by Motherboard, delivery companies are allotted four weeks of practice with Netradyne cameras before its metrics impact their scores, but none of the drivers Motherboard spoke to said they received formal training on how Netradyne “events” can impact their scorecards.

In July, Motherboard reported that two Amazon delivery companies in Portland terminated their contracts with Amazon, in a rare act of protest against Amazon for imposing a financially unsustainable business model on them. In a letter to Amazon, their lawyer cited the Netradyne cameras as one way Amazon exerts unreasonable control over their business operations.

Amazon's delivery service partner program relies on 2,000 small delivery companies that employ 115,000 drivers in the United States to deliver billions of packages each year. Amazon skirts liability for these drivers through this contract model, but requires delivery companies to adhere to a set of rules around hiring, drivers' appearances and social media activity, pay, routes, and safety mechanisms, including Netradyne cameras.

Motherboard spoke to four drivers and the owner of an Amazon delivery company who said it isn't possible under most circumstances for an Amazon delivery company to appeal erroneous violations with Amazon, although Amazon does have an automated portal for the appeal process where delivery companies can submit a feedback ticket to Amazon and dispute “events.”

“If you get an event at our company, you get a phone call. It’s an ass chewing. We’re not able to go to the manager or [delivery service partner] owner to appeal,” the driver in Oklahoma said. “We would love to but they won’t bother with it, unless you have clear evidence already.”

AI experts have noted that Amazon and other companies rely on algorithms, such as worker surveillance systems, that increase their profits and cut wages. “The ability of automated management platforms to manipulate (and arbitrarily cut) wages has been at the heart of worker grievances,” a 2019 report from New York University's AI Now Institute said. “AI threatens not only to disproportionately displace lower-wage earners, but also to reduce wages, job security, and other protections for those who need it most.”

A spokesperson for Amazon told Motherboard that a team of Amazon employees manually reviews all events that are appealed to ensure that erroneous events do not impact drivers or Amazon delivery companies.

The delivery company owner in Washington said the number of events registered by Netradyne per week, the amount of labor involved in reviewing them, and the low likelihood that an “event” would be overturned, made the appeal process futile....",America,2020.02.24,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/117,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genderify, a new service that promised to identify someone’s gender by analyzing their name, email address, or username with the help AI, looks firmly to be in the latter camp. The company launched on Product Hunt last week, but picked up a lot of attention on social media as users discovered biases and inaccuracies in its algorithms.

Type the name “Meghan Smith” into Genderify, for example, and the service offers the assessment: “Male: 39.60%, Female: 60.40%.” Change that name to “Dr. Meghan Smith,” however, and the assessment changes to: “Male: 75.90%, Female: 24.10%.” Other names prefixed with “Dr” produce similar results while inputs seem to generally skew male. “Test@test.com” is said to be 96.90 percent male, for example, while “Mrs Joan smith” is 94.10 percent male.

The outcry against the service has been so great that Genderify tells The Verge it’s shutting down altogether. “If the community don’t want it, maybe it was fair,” said a representative via email. Genderify.com has been taken offline and its free API is no longer accessible.

AI bias in action: https://t.co/vRM53tEUMs pic.twitter.com/YgLON4vpT8

Although these sorts of biases appear regularly in machine learning systems, the thoughtlessness of Genderify seems to have surprised many experts in the field. The response from Meredith Whittaker, co-founder of the AI Now Institute, which studies the impact of AI on society, was somewhat typical. “Are we being trolled?” she asked. “Is this a psyop meant to distract the tech+justice world? Is it cringey tech April fool’s day already?”

MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE’S GENDER AT SCALE COULD BE HARMFUL

The problem is not that Genderify made assumptions about someone’s gender based on their name. People do this all the time, and sometimes make mistakes in the process. That’s why it’s polite to find out how people self-identify and how they want to be addressed. The problem with Genderify is that it automated these assumptions; applying them at scale while sorting individuals into a male/female binary (and so ignoring individuals who identify as non-binary) while reinforcing gender stereotypes in the process (such as: if you’re a doctor you’re probably a man).

The potential harm of this depends on how and where Genderify was applied. If the service was integrated into a medical chatbot, for example, its assumptions about users’ genders might have led to the chatbot issuing misleading medical advice.

Thankfully, Genderify didn’t seem to be aiming to automate this sort of system, but was primarily designed to be a marketing tool. As Genderify’s creator, Arevik Gasparyan, said on Product Hunt: “Genderify can obtain data that will help you with analytics, enhancing your customer data, segmenting your marketing database, demographic statistics, etc.”

In the same comment section, Gasparyan acknowledged the concerns of some users about bias and ignoring non-binary individuals, but didn’t offer any concrete answers.

One user asked: “Let’s say I choose to identify as neither Male or Female, how do you approach this? How do you avoid gender discrimination? How are you tackling gender bias?” To which Gasparyan replied that the service makes its decisions based on “already existing binary name/gender databases,” and that the company was “actively looking into ways of improving the experience for transgender and non-binary visitors” by “separating the concepts of name/username/email from gender identity.” It’s a confusing answer given that the entire premise of Genderify is that this data is a reliable proxy for gender identity.

The company told The Verge that the service was very similar to existing companies who use databases of names to guess an individual’s gender, though none of them use AI.

“We understand that our model will never provide ideal results, and the algorithm needs significant improvements, but our goal was to build a self-learning AI that will not be biased as any existing solutions,” said a representative via email. “And to make it work, we very much relied on the feedback of transgender and non-binary visitors to help us improve our gender detection algorithms as best as possible for the LGBTQ+ community.”...",America,2021.09.20,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/116,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The members of Congress who were falsely matched with the mugshot database we used in the test include Republicans and Democrats, men and women, and legislators of all ages, from all across the country.",The algorithm is not capable enough when dealing with similar faces. The algorithm itself has large loopholes and the training set may also have problems.,"Data acquisition,Data access,Data modeling,Surprising learning result",uncertain,Negative,No relevant measures have been found so far.,"Amazon’s face surveillance technology is the target of growing opposition nationwide, and today, there are 28 more causes for concern. In a test the ACLU recently conducted of the facial recognition tool, called “Rekognition,” the software incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress, identifying them as other people who have been arrested for a crime.

The members of Congress who were falsely matched with the mugshot database we used in the test include Republicans and Democrats, men and women, and legislators of all ages, from all across the country.

The false matches were disproportionately of people of color, including six members of the Congressional Black Caucus, among them civil rights legend Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.). These results demonstrate why Congress should join the ACLU in calling for a moratorium on law enforcement use of face surveillance.

To conduct our test, we used the exact same facial recognition system that Amazon offers to the public, which anyone could use to scan for matches between images of faces. And running the entire test cost us $12.33 — less than a large pizza.

Using Rekognition, we built a face database and search tool using 25,000 publicly available arrest photos. Then we searched that database against public photos of every current member of the House and Senate. We used the default match settings that Amazon sets for Rekognition.

In a recent letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the Congressional Black Caucus expressed concern about the “profound negative unintended consequences” face surveillance could have for Black people, undocumented immigrants, and protesters. Academic research has also already shown that face recognition is less accurate for darker-skinned faces and women. Our results validate this concern: Nearly 40 percent of Rekognition’s false matches in our test were of people of color, even though they make up only 20 percent of Congress.

If law enforcement is using Amazon Rekognition, it’s not hard to imagine a police officer getting a “match” indicating that a person has a previous concealed-weapon arrest, biasing the officer before an encounter even begins. Or an individual getting a knock on the door from law enforcement, and being questioned or having their home searched, based on a false identification.

An identification — whether accurate or not — could cost people their freedom or even their lives. People of color are already disproportionately harmed by police practices, and it’s easy to see how Rekognition could exacerbate that. A recent incident in San Francisco provides a disturbing illustration of that risk. Police stopped a car, handcuffed an elderly Black woman and forced her to kneel at gunpoint — all because an automatic license plate reader improperly identified her car as a stolen vehicle.

Matching people against arrest photos is not a hypothetical exercise. Amazon is aggressively marketing its face surveillance technology to police, boasting that its service can identify up to 100 faces in a single image, track people in real time through surveillance cameras, and scan footage from body cameras. A sheriff’s department in Oregon has already started using Amazon Rekognition to compare people’s faces against a mugshot database, without any public debate.

Face surveillance also threatens to chill First Amendment-protected activity like engaging in protest or practicing religion, and it can be used to subject immigrants to further abuse from the government.

These dangers are why Amazon employees, shareholders, a coalition of nearly 70 civil rights groups, over 400 members of the academic community, and more than 150,000 members of the public have already spoken up to demand that Amazon stop providing face surveillance to the government.

Congress must take these threats seriously, hit the brakes, and enact a moratorium on law enforcement use of face recognition. This technology shouldn’t be used until the harms are fully considered and all necessary steps are taken to prevent them from harming vulnerable communities.",Global,2020.07.28,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/115,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The video, dated June 27, 2020, was by The Daily Mail and featured clips of Black men in altercations with white civilians and police officers. It had no connection to monkeys or primates.

Darci Groves, a former content design manager at Facebook, said a friend had recently sent her a screenshot of the prompt. She then posted it to a product feedback forum for current and former Facebook employees. In response, a product manager for Facebook Watch, the company’s video service, called it “unacceptable” and said the company was “looking into the root cause.”

Ms. Groves said the prompt was “horrifying and egregious.”

Dani Lever, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement: “As we have said, while we have made improvements to our A.I., we know it’s not perfect, and we have more progress to make. We apologize to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations.”

Google, Amazon and other technology companies have been under scrutiny for years for biases within their artificial intelligence systems, particularly around issues of race. Studies have shown that facial recognition technology is biased against people of color and has more trouble identifying them, leading to incidents where Black people have been discriminated against or arrested because of computer error.

In one example in 2015, Google Photos mistakenly labeled pictures of Black people as “gorillas,” for which Google said it was “genuinely sorry” and would work to fix the issue immediately. More than two years later, Wired found that Google’s solution was to censor the word “gorilla” from searches, while also blocking “chimp,” “chimpanzee” and “monkey.”

Facebook has one of the world’s largest repositories of user-uploaded images on which to train its facial- and object-recognition algorithms. The company, which tailors content to users based on their past browsing and viewing habits, sometimes asks people if they would like to continue seeing posts under related categories. It was unclear whether messages like the “primates” one were widespread.

Facebook and its photo-sharing app, Instagram, have struggled with other issues related to race. After July’s European Championship in soccer, for instance, three Black members of England’s national soccer team were racially abused on the social network for missing penalty kicks in the championship game.

Racial issues have also caused internal strife at Facebook. In 2016, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, asked employees to stop crossing out the phrase “Black Lives Matter” and replacing it with “All Lives Matter” in a communal space in the company’s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters. Hundreds of employees also staged a virtual walkout last year to protest the company’s handling of a post from President Donald J. Trump about the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

The company later hired a vice president of civil rights and released a civil rights audit. In an annual diversity report in July, Facebook said 4.4 percent of its U.S.-based employees were Black, up from 3.9 percent the year before.

Ms. Groves, who left Facebook over the summer after four years, said in an interview that a series of missteps at the company suggested that dealing with racial problems wasn’t a priority for its leaders.

""We are discontinuing Shot-Spotter,"" Chief John Tedesco said Tuesday night during the Public Safety Committee's review of the police department budget for 2013.

Dropping the system means the city will save $39,000 in annual costs. Tedesco said the company had been pressuring the department to upgrade the system, which would have moved monitoring to California instead of in police headquarters.

The displeasure with the acoustic surveillance system is so prevalent that Tedesco and Officer Robert Fitzgerald, the Troy Police Benevolent Association president, who usually disagree on issues, both agree that it's time is over.

""We're getting a better response from the public,"" Fitzgerald said about calls residents made to report gunfire.

The chief and union president said the patrol officers supported dumping ShotSpotter.

Tedesco said the system never achieved what it was suppose to do when the city installed it for $250,000 in 2009 using drug forfeiture money to cover the cost.

""It wasn't reliable,"" Tedesco said.

It also was expensive, the chief said. Moving one of the listening devices, he said, cost $6,500.

The system was suppose to become attuned to the way sounds were heard in Troy's streets and differentiate among the brakes of a truck climbing the Hoosic Street hill, from a firecracker, actual shots and any other noise.

Tedesco said this was never completely achieved.

Mayor Lou Rosamilia said he backed the decision to end participation in ShotSpotter.

""It's not working in the way it's suppose to,"" Rosamilia said.

A ShotSpotter spokeswoman could not be immediately reached Tuesday night for comment.

Troy installed a network of 22 acoustic listening devices to cover the neighborhoods with the highest crime incidents.

The city rolled out the surveillance devices with great fanfare in late 2008. It was supposed to lead officers to the sites where shots were fired when not reported by the public.

Rosamilia, Tedesco and Fitzgerald each said that unlike in some cities, Troy residents call in reports of gunshots.

At first, police touted the system as an early success. Each patrol car had access to the computerized monitoring system installed to allow officers to get the information firsthand.

It was expected to take a full year to fine-tune the acoustic devices so it would pick out the gunshots from other sounds. Tedesco said that never occurred.

The listening devices were placed to cover an area that ran from Lansingburgh south through downtown and into South Troy. The system also picked up sounds from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute campus.

Normandin’s experience is a twist on the decades-old prediction that robots will replace workers. At Amazon, machines are often the boss—hiring, rating and firingmillions of people with little or no human oversight.

Amazon became the world’s largest online retailer in part by outsourcing its sprawling operations to algorithms—sets of computer instructions designed to solve specific problems. For years, the company has used algorithms to manage the millions of third-party merchants on its online marketplace, drawing complaints that sellers have been booted off after being falsely accused of selling counterfeit goods and jacking up prices.

Increasingly, the company is ceding its human-resources operation to machines as well, using software not only to manage workers in its warehouses but to oversee contract drivers, independent delivery companies and even the performance of its office workers. People familiar with the strategy say Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos believes machines make decisions more quickly and accurately than people, reducing costs and giving Amazon a competitive advantage.

Amazon started its gig-style Flex delivery service in 2015, and the army of contract drivers quickly became a critical part of the company’s delivery machine. Typically, Flex drivers handle packages that haven’t been loaded on an Amazon van before the driver leaves. Rather than making the customer wait, Flex drivers ensure the packages are delivered the same day. They also handle a large number of same-day grocery deliveries from Amazon’s Whole Foods Market chain. Flex drivers helped keep Amazon humming during the pandemic and were only too happy to earn about $25 an hour shuttling packages after their Uber and Lyft gigs dried up.

But the moment they sign on, Flex drivers discover algorithms are monitoring their every move. Did they get to the delivery station when they said they would? Did they complete their route in the prescribed window? Did they leave a package in full view of porch pirates instead of hidden behind a planter as requested? Amazon algorithms scan the gusher of incoming data for performance patterns and decide which drivers get more routes and which are deactivated. Human feedback is rare. Drivers occasionally receive automated emails, but mostly they’re left to obsess about their ratings, which include four categories: Fantastic, Great, Fair or At Risk.

Bloomberg interviewed 15 Flex drivers, including four who say they were wrongly terminated, as well as former Amazon managers who say the largely automated system is insufficiently attuned to the real-world challenges drivers face every day. Amazon knew delegating work to machines would lead to mistakes and damaging headlines, these former managers said, but decided it was cheaper to trust the algorithms than pay people to investigate mistaken firings so long as the drivers could be replaced easily.

So far, Amazon has had no trouble finding Flex contractors. Globally, some 4 million drivers have downloaded the app, including 2.9 million in the U.S., according to App Annie. And more than 660,000 people in the U.S. downloaded it in the first five months of this year, up 21% from the same period a year ago, according to SensorTower, another app tracker.

Inside Amazon, the Flex program is considered a great success, whose benefits far outweigh the collateral damage, said a former engineer who helped design the system. “Executives knew this was gonna shit the bed,” this person said. “That’s actually how they put it in meetings. The only question was how much poo we wanted there to be.”

In a statement, Amazon spokeswoman Kate Kudrna called drivers’ claims of poor treatment and unfair termination anecdotal and said they don’t represent the experience of the vast majority of Flex drivers. “We have invested heavily in technology and resources to provide drivers visibility into their standing and eligibility to continue delivering, and investigate all driver appeals,” she said.

As independent contractors, Flex drivers have little recourse when they believe they’ve been deactivated unfairly. There’s no paid administrative leave during an appeal. Drivers can pay $200 to take their dispute to arbitration, but few do, seeing it as a waste of time and money.

When Ryan Cope was deactivated in 2019, he didn’t bother arguing or consider paying for arbitration. By then, Cope had already decided there was no way he could meet the algorithms’ demands. Driving miles along winding dirt roads outside Denver in the snow, he often shook his head in disbelief that Amazon expected the customer to get the package within two hours.

“Whenever there’s an issue, there’s no support,” said Cope, who is 29. “It’s you against the machine, so you don’t even try.”

When drivers do challenge poor ratings, they can’t tell if they’re communicating with real people. Responses often include just a first name or no name at all, and the replies typically apply to a variety of situations rather than a specific problem. Even if a name is attached, a machine most likely generated the first few email responses, according to people familiar with the matter.

When human managers get involved, they typically conduct a hasty review—if they do one at all—because they must meet their own performance standards. A former employee at a driver support call center said dozens of part-time seasonal workers with little training were assigned to oversee issues for millions of drivers.

“Amazon doesn’t care,” the former Amazon employee said. “They know most people will get their packages and the 2 or 3 percent who don’t will get something eventually.”

Amazon has automated its human-resources operation more than most companies. But the use of algorithms to make decisions affecting people’s lives is increasingly common. Machines can approve loan applications, and even decide if someone deserves parole or should stay behind bars. Computer science experts have called for regulations forcing companies to be transparent about how algorithms affect people, giving them the information they need to call out and correct mistakes. Legislatorshave studied the matter but have been slow to enact rules to prevent harm. In December, Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, introduced the Algorithmic Fairness Act. It would require the Federal Trade Commission to create rules that ensure algorithms are being used equitably and that those affected by their decisions are informed and have the opportunity to reverse mistakes. So far his proposal has gone nowhere.

Neddra Lira, of Arlington, Texas, started making deliveries through the Amazon Flex app in 2017. A 42-year-old school-bus driver and mother of three, she took the side job during holiday breaks and summers to earn extra money, which she used to pay for her daughter’s gymnastics lessons. When the pandemic hit and schools closed, Lira turned to Flex as her primary source of income, delivering packages as well as groceries from Whole Foods. She liked the flexibility and opportunity to pocket about $80 for a four-hour route, after subtracting gas for her Chevrolet Trax crossover.

Lira estimates she delivered about 8,000 packages and had a “great” performance rating most of the time. Amazon algorithms rate drivers based on their reliability and delivery quality, mostly measured by whether they arrived to pick up packages on time, if they made the deliveries within the expected window and followed customers’ special requests. Flex metrics focus mostly on punctuality, unlike ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, which also prioritize things like a car’s cleanliness or driver courtesy. Moreover, Uber and Lyft passengers know when they’re stuck in traffic, so drivers are less likely to be penalized for circumstances beyond their control.

An Amazon customer has no idea what obstacles Flex drivers encounter on the way to their residence, and neither do the algorithms clocking them. Lira says sometimes there were so many drivers lined up outside the delivery station, she waited as long as an hour to retrieve her packages, putting her behind schedule before she even started her route. When she spotted a nail in her tire, Amazon didn’t offer to come retrieve the packages but asked her to return them to the delivery station. Lira was afraid the tire would go flat but complied to protect her standing. Despite explaining the situation, her rating dropped to “at risk” from “great” for abandoning the route and took several weeks to recover.

Time and again, Lira was reassured that her rating was fine. A typical email arrived on Oct. 1. “Your standing is currently great, which means you’re one of our best delivery partners,” said the message signed “Madhu S.” But the very next day, “Bhanu Prakash” emailed to say she had violated Flex’s terms of service. “As a result, you’re no longer eligible to participate in the Amazon Flex program and won’t be able to sign in to the Amazon Flex app.”

Lira was provided an email address and invited to appeal the termination within 10 days. She did so and asked why she was deactivated so she could tell Flex driver support what went wrong. She never got further specifics. She followed up Oct. 18, explaining that she was a single mother laid off from her regular job due to the pandemic and that Flex was the only thing keeping her afloat. Lira received what appears to be an automated response from “The Amazon Flex Team” apologizing for the delay and assuring her that her situation would be investigated by the appropriate team.

Three days later, on Oct. 21, she received a message from “Margaret” saying “we are still reviewing your appeal.” Then a week later, on Oct. 28, an email signed “SYAM” said, “We’ve reviewed your information and taken another look at your history. Our position has not changed and we won’t be reinstating your access to the Amazon Flex program… We wish you success in your future endeavors.”

Without the driving gig, Lira began to struggle financially. She stopped paying her mortgage, and her car was repossessed two days after Christmas with donated presents for her kids still inside. Lira was forced to take a government handout to pay her electric, gas and water bills. Eventually she started driving the school bus again and used most of a pandemic stimulus check to get her car back, paying $2,800 in missed payments, repossession and storage fees.

“It just wasn’t fair,” Lira said. “I nearly lost my house.”

The computer engineers who designed Flex worked hard to make it fair and consider such variables as traffic jams and problems accessing apartments that the system can’t detect, former employees said. But no algorithm is perfect, and at Amazon’s size even a small margin of error can be considered a huge success internally and still inflict a lot of pain on drivers. Amazon Flex drivers deliver about 95% of all packages on time and without issues, according to a person familiar with the program. Algorithms examine that remaining 5% for problematic patterns.

The Flex algorithms began as blunt instruments and were refined over time. Early on, according to a person familiar with the situation, designers set too tight a time period for drivers to get to the delivery station. They had failed to factor in human nature. Drivers eager for work would promise to arrive by a certain time when they were too far away to make it. The flaw set good drivers up to fail, the person said, and was fixed only after a widespread plunge in ratings. The system also uses GPS to decide how long it should take to reach a specific address but sometimes fails to account for the fact that navigating a rural road in the snow takes a lot longer than traversing a suburban street on a sunny day.

The system worked fine for Normandin for years. An Arizona native who previously delivered pizzas at night and newspapers in the morning, he knew all the short cuts and traffic choke points. He also drove for Uber and Lyft, but took on more Flex work during the pandemic when demand for rides dropped and it became riskier ferrying passengers than carting packages.

Normandin enjoyed stellar ratings and was even asked if he’d like to train other drivers. He had a well-honed system: sorting packages before leaving the station, putting his first deliveries in the front seat, the next several packages in the rear and tucking the last batch deep in the back of his 2002 Toyota Corolla. Normandin has been medically disabled for more than a decade due to a stomach ailment and back problems that prevent him from sitting or standing in one place for prolonged periods. He liked gig work because he could work a few hours at a time.

Then, starting last August, Normandin had a string of setbacks he maintains were beyond his control. Amazon assigned him some pre-dawn deliveries at apartment complexes when their gates were still locked, a common complaint among Flex drivers. The algorithm instructs drivers in such instances to deliver packages to the main office, but that wasn’t open either. Normandin called the customer as instructed—a long shot because most people don’t answer calls from unfamiliar numbers, especially early morning. He called driver support, which couldn’t get through to the customer either. Meanwhile, the clock was ticking, and the algorithm was taking note.

“There are a lot of things the algorithms don't take into consideration and the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing,” Normandin said.

Around the same time, he was asked to deliver packages to an Amazon locker in an apartment complex but couldn’t open it. After 30 minutes on the phone with support he was told to return the packages to the delivery station. Then his rating crashed. Normandin called support again to explain that a malfunctioning locker was responsible and says he was told the problem would be remedied. “They never fixed it,” he said, “and it took six weeks for my rating to go back up.”

On Oct. 2, Normandin woke at 3 a.m., showered and grabbed his phone to find a Flex route but couldn’t log on. He checked his email and found a generic message from Amazon signed by “Gangardhar M.” It said Normandin’s standing had “dropped below an acceptable level” and that he was being terminated.

Then began a process familiar to anyone who has found themselves trapped in an automated customer-service loop—except in this case Normandin wasn’t seeking a refund for a damaged product. He was fighting to get his job back.

Offered Amazon’s standard 10 days to appeal, Normandin emailed Flex support and asked that his termination be reversed. He explained that he had already flagged Amazon about circumstances beyond his control and had been promised the infractions wouldn’t be held against him

Normandin received a response the next day from “Pavani G,” thanking him for “providing more context about your history with Amazon Flex.” Normandin responded to that email with additional information and received the same exact response promising to look into the issue, but this time it was signed by “Bitan Banerjee.” The email pledged to provide an answer within six days. Seven days later, “Arnab” emailed to apologize for the delay and promised an update as soon as possible.

Meanwhile, Normandin wasn’t making any money. He was counting on Amazon’s annual Prime Day sale, which had been pushed back to October, to make money he needed to pay bills. With no response by Oct. 19, Normandin messaged Amazon again, this time copying Bezos.

“I am asking for specific details on how this decision for deactivation of my account was reached,” he wrote. “I am confident after a thorough review of my entire delivery history as an Amazon Flex driver will show a consistent history of performing at the highest level, of a reasonable and prudent person.”

About 12 hours later, he got a response informing him that Bezos had received the email and instructed “Taylor F” to research the issue and respond on his behalf. On Oct. 23, Normandin received an email from “Raquel” on the Amazon Flex Support Team to tell him they were still reviewing his appeal. Former Amazon employees who worked on Flex said escalating to Bezos is a common tactic among deactivated drivers but seldom helps them.

The verdict arrived on Oct. 28 from “SYAM,” the same name in the final message to Lira. The email didn’t directly respond to Normandin’s claims but acknowledged the job’s challenges, saying: “We understand that every delivery partner has difficult days and that you may sometimes experience delays, and we have already taken this into account.” But Normandin still wasn’t getting his gig back.

After the shock subsided, he tried a couple of other delivery services but instead decided to use his pandemic stimulus money to start a small-engine repair business. It was time to deal directly with human beings again. Of the people who designed the algorithms that tracked, rated and eventually fired him, Normandin said: “It seems they don’t have any common sense about how the real world works.”",America,2016.04.01,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/112,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There, under a Medicaid waiver program, assessors interviewed beneficiaries and decided how frequently the caretaker should visit. Dobbs’ needs were extensive. Her illness left her in a wheelchair and her hands stiffened. The most basic tasks of life — getting out of bed, going to the bathroom, bathing — required assistance, not to mention the trips to yard sales she treasured.

For years, she managed well. An aide arrived daily at 8AM, helped Dobbs out of bed, into the bathroom, and then made breakfast. She would return at lunch, then again in the evening for dinner and any household tasks that needed to be done, before helping Dobbs into bed. The final moments were especially important: wherever Dobbs was placed to sleep, she’d stay until the aide returned 11 hours later.

Dobbs received regular reassessments of her needs, but they didn’t worry her. She wouldn’t be recovering, after all, so it didn’t seem likely that changes would be made to her care.

When an assessor arrived in 2016 and went over her situation, it was a familiar process: how much help did she need to use the bathroom? What about eating? How was her emotional state? The woman typed notes into a computer and, when it was over, gave Dobbs a shocking verdict: her hours would be cut, to just 32 per week.

Dobbs says she went “ballistic” on the woman. She pleaded, explaining how that simply wasn’t enough, but neither of them, Dobbs says, seemed to quite understand what was happening. Dobbs’ situation hadn’t improved, but an invisible change had occurred. When the assessor entered Dobbs’ information into the computer, it ran through an algorithm that the state had recently approved, determining how many hours of help she would receive.

Other people around the state were also struggling to understand the often drastic changes. As people in the program talked to each other, hundreds of them complained that their most important lifeline had been cut, and they were unable to understand why.

Algorithmic tools like the one Arkansas instituted in 2016 are everywhere from health care to law enforcement, altering lives in ways the people affected can usually only glimpse, if they know they’re being used at all. Even if the details of the algorithms are accessible, which isn’t always the case, they’re often beyond the understanding even of the people using them, raising questions about what transparency means in an automated age, and concerns about people’s ability to contest decisions made by machines.

Planning for the cut in care, Dobbs calculated what she could do without, choosing between trips to church or keeping the house clean. She had always dabbled in poetry, and later wrote a simple, seven-stanza piece called “Hour Dilemma,” directed toward the state. She wrote that institutionalization would be a “nightmare,” and asked the state “to return to the human based assessment.”

The change left Dobbs in a situation she never thought she would be in, as the program she’d relied on for years fell out from below her. “I thought they would take care of me,” she says.

The algorithm that upended Dobbs’ life fits comfortably, when printed, on about 20 pages. Although it’s difficult to decipher without expert help, the algorithm computes about 60 descriptions, symptoms, and ailments — fever, weight loss, ventilator use — into categories, each one corresponding to a number of hours of home care.

Like many industries, health care has turned to automation for efficiency. The algorithm used in Arkansas is one of a family of tools, called “instruments,” that attempt to provide a snapshot of a person’s health in order to inform decisions about care everywhere from nursing homes to hospitals and prisons.

The instrument used in Arkansas was designed by InterRAI, a nonprofit coalition of health researchers from around the world. Brant Fries, a University of Michigan professor in the school’s Department of Health Management and Policy who is now the president of InterRAI, started developing algorithms in the 1980s, originally for use in nursing homes. The instruments are licensed to software vendors for a “small royalty,” he says, and the users are asked to send data back to InterRAI. The group’s tools are used in health settings in nearly half of US states, as well as in several countries.

In home care, the problem of allocating help is particularly acute. The United States is inadequately prepared to care for a population that’s living longer, and the situation has caused problems for both the people who need care and the aides themselves, some of whom say they’re led into working unpaid hours. As needs increase, states have been prompted to look for new ways to contain costs and distribute what resources they have.

States have taken diverging routes to solve the problem, according to Vincent Mor, a Brown professor who studies health policy and is an InterRAI member. California, he says, has a sprawling, multilayered home care system, while some smaller states rely on personal assessments alone. Before using the algorithmic system, assessors in Arkansas had wide leeway to assign whatever hours they thought were necessary. In many states, “you meet eligibility requirements, a case manager or nurse or social worker will make an individualized plan for you,” Mor says.

Arkansas has said the previous, human-based system was ripe for favoritism and arbitrary decisions. “We knew there would be changes for some individuals because, again, this assessment is much more objective,” a spokesperson told the Arkansas Times after the system was implemented. Aid recipients have pointed to a lack of evidence showing such bias in the state. Arkansas officials also say a substantial percentage of people had their hours raised, while recipients argue the state has also been unable to produce data on the scope of the changes in either direction. The Arkansas Department of Human Services, which administers the program, declined to answer any questions for this story, citing a lawsuit unfolding in state court.

When similar health care systems have been automated, they have not always performed flawlessly, and their errors can be difficult to correct. The scholar Danielle Keats Citron cites the example of Colorado, where coders placed more than 900 incorrect rules into its public benefits system in the mid-2000s, resulting in problems like pregnant women being denied Medicaid. Similar issues in California, Citron writes in a paper, led to “overpayments, underpayments, and improper terminations of public benefits,” as foster children were incorrectly denied Medicaid. Citron writes about the need for “technological due process” — the importance of both understanding what’s happening in automated systems and being given meaningful ways to challenge them.

Critics point out that, when designing these programs, incentives are not always aligned with easy interfaces and intelligible processes. Virginia Eubanks, the author of Automating Inequality, says many programs in the United States are “premised on the idea that their first job is diversion,” increasing barriers to services and at times making the process so difficult to navigate “that it just means that people who really need these services aren’t able to get them.”

One of the most bizarre cases happened in Idaho, where the state made an attempt, like Arkansas, to institute an algorithm for allocating home care and community integration funds, but built it in-house. The state’s home care program calculated what it would cost to care for severely disabled people, then allotted funds to pay for help. But around 2011, when a new formula was instituted, those funds suddenly dropped precipitously for many people, by as much as 42 percent. When the people whose benefits were cut tried to determine how their benefits were determined, the state declined to disclose the formula it was using, saying that its math qualified as a trade secret.

In 2012, the local ACLU branch brought suit on behalf of the program’s beneficiaries, arguing that Idaho’s actions had deprived them of their rights to due process. In court, it was revealed that, when the state was building its tool, it relied on deeply flawed data, and threw away most of it immediately. Still, the state went ahead with the data that was left over. “It really, truly went wrong at every step of the process of developing this kind of formula,” ACLU of Idaho legal director Richard Eppink says.

Most importantly, when Idaho’s system went haywire, it was impossible for the average person to understand or challenge. A court wrote that “the participants receive no explanation for the denial, have no written standards to refer to for guidance, and often have no family member, guardian, or paid assistance to help them.” The appeals process was difficult to navigate, and Eppink says it was “really meaningless” anyway, as the people who received appeals couldn’t understand the formula, either. They would look at the system and say, “It’s beyond my authority and my expertise to question the quality of this result.”

Idaho has since agreed to improve the tool and create a system that Eppink says will be more “transparent, understandable, and fair.” He says there might be an ideal formula out there that, when the right variables are entered, has gears that turn without friction, allocating assistance in the perfect way. But if the system is so complex that it’s impossible to make intelligible for the people it’s affecting, it’s not doing its job, Eppink argues. “You have to be able to understand what a machine did.”

“That’s an argument,” Fries says. “I find that to be really strange.” He’s sympathetic to the people who had their hours cut in Arkansas. Whenever one of his systems is implemented, he says, he recommends that people under old programs be grandfathered in, or at least have their care adjusted gradually; the people in these programs are “not going to live that long, probably,” he says. He also suggests giving humans some room to adjust the results, and he acknowledges that moving rapidly from an “irrational” to a “rational” system, without properly explaining why, is painful. Arkansas officials, he says, didn’t listen to his advice. “What they did was, in my mind, really stupid,” he says. People who were used to a certain level of care were thrust into a new system, “and they screamed.”

Fries says he knows the assessment process — having a person come in, give an interview, feed numbers into a machine, and having it spit out a determination — is not necessarily comfortable. But, he says, the system provides a way to allocate care that’s backed by studies. “You could argue everybody ought to get a lot more care out there,” he says, but an algorithm allows state officials to do what they can with the resources they have.

As for the transparency of the system, he agrees that the algorithm is impossible for most to easily understand, but says that it’s not a problem. “It’s not simple,” he says. “My washing machine isn’t simple.” But if you can capture complexity in more detail, Fries argues, this will ultimately serve the public better, and at some point, “you’re going to have to trust me that a bunch of smart people determined this is the smart way to do it.”

Shortly after Arkansas started using the algorithm in 2016, Kevin De Liban, an attorney for Legal Aid of Arkansas, started to receive complaints. Someone said they were hospitalized because their care was cut. A slew of others wrote in about radical readjustments.

De Liban first learned about the change from a program beneficiary named Bradley Ledgerwood. The Ledgerwood family lives in the tiny city of Cash, in the Northeast of the state. Bradley, the son, has cerebral palsy, but stays active, following basketball and Republican politics, and serving on the city council.

When Bradley was younger, his grandmother took care of him during the day, but as he got older and bigger, she couldn’t lift him, and the situation became untenable. Bradley’s parents debated what to do and eventually decided that his mother, Ann, would stay home to care for him. The decision meant a severe financial hit; Ann had a job doing appraisals for the county she would have to quit. But the Arkansas program gave them a path to recover some of those losses. The state would reimburse Ann a small hourly rate to compensate her for taking care of Bradley, with the number of reimbursable hours determined by an assessment of his care needs.

When the state moved over to its new system, the Ledgerwood family’s hours were also substantially cut. Bradley had dealt with the Arkansas Department of Human Services, which administered the program, in a previous battle over a dispute on home care hours and reached out to De Liban, who agreed to look into it.

With Bradley and an elderly woman named Ethel Jacobs as the plaintiffs, Legal Aid filed a federal lawsuit in 2016, arguing that the state had instituted a new policy without properly notifying the people affected about the change. There was also no way to effectively challenge the system, as they couldn’t understand what information factored into the changes, De Liban argued. No one seemed able to answer basic questions about the process. “The nurses said, ‘It’s not me; it’s the computer,’” De Liban says.

At the time, they knew it was some sort of new, computer-based system, but there was no mention of an algorithm; the math behind the change only came out after the lawsuit was filed. “It didn’t make any sense to me in the beginning,” De Liban says. When they dug into the system, they discovered more about how it works. Out of the lengthy list of items that assessors asked about, only about 60 factored into the home care algorithm. The algorithm scores the answers to those questions, and then sorts people into categories through a flowchart-like system. It turned out that a small number of variables could matter enormously: for some people, a difference between a score of a three instead of a four on any of a handful of items meant a cut of dozens of care hours a month. (Fries didn’t say this was wrong, but said, when dealing with these systems, “there are always people at the margin who are going to be problematic.”)

De Liban started keeping a list of what he thought of as “algorithmic absurdities.” One variable in the assessment was foot problems. When an assessor visited a certain person, they wrote that the person didn’t have any problems — because they were an amputee. Over time, De Liban says, they discovered wildly different scores when the same people were assessed, despite being in the same condition. (Fries says studies suggest this rarely happens.) De Liban also says negative changes, like a person contracting pneumonia, could counterintuitively lead them to receive fewer help hours because the flowchart-like algorithm would place them in a different category. (Fries denied this, saying the algorithm accounts for it.)

But from the state’s perspective, the most embarrassing moment in the dispute happened during questioning in court. Fries was called in to answer questions about the algorithm and patiently explained to De Liban how the system works. After some back-and-forth, De Liban offered a suggestion: “Would you be able to take somebody’s assessment report and then sort them into a category?” (He said later he wanted to understand what changes triggered the reduction from one year to the next.)

Fries said he could, although it would take a little time. He looked over the numbers for Ethel Jacobs. After a break, a lawyer for the state came back and sheepishly admitted to the court: there was a mistake. Somehow, the wrong calculation was being used. They said they would restore Jacobs’ hours.

“Of course we’re gratified that DHS has reported the error and certainly happy that it’s been found, but that almost proves the point of the case,” De Liban said in court. “There’s this immensely complex system around which no standards have been published, so that no one in their agency caught it until we initiated federal litigation and spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars to get here today. That’s the problem.”

It came out in the court case that the problem was with a third-party software vendor implementing the system, which mistakenly used a version of the algorithm that didn’t account for diabetes issues. There was also a separate problem with cerebral palsy, which wasn’t properly coded in the algorithm, and that caused incorrect calculations for hundreds of people, mostly lowering their hours.

“As far as we knew, we were doing it the right way,” Douglas Zimmer, the president of the vendor, a company called the Center for Information Management, says about using the algorithm that did not include diabetes issues. New York also uses this version of the algorithm. He says the cerebral palsy coding problem was “an error on our part.”

“If states are using something so complex that they don’t understand it, how do we know that it’s working right?” De Liban says. “What if there’s errors?”

Fries later wrote in a report to the state that about 19 percent of all beneficiaries were negatively impacted by the diabetes omission. He told me that the swapped algorithms amounted to a “very, very marginal call,” and that, overall, it wasn’t unreasonable for the state to continue using the system that allotted fewer hours, as New York has decided to. In the report and with me, he said the diabetes change was not an “error,” although the report says the more widely used algorithm was a “slightly better” match for Arkansas. One item listed as a “pro” in the report: moving back to the original algorithm was “responsive to trial result,” as it would raise the plaintiffs’ hours close to their previous levels. It’s not clear whether the state has since started counting diabetes issues. As of December, an official said he believed they weren’t. The Department of Human Services declined to comment.

But in internal emails seen by The Verge, Arkansas officials discussed the cerebral palsy coding error and the best course of action. On an email chain, the officials suggested that, since some of the people who had their hours reduced didn’t appeal the decision, they effectively waived their legal right to fight it. (“How is somebody supposed to appeal and determine there’s a problem with the software when DHS itself didn’t determine that?” De Liban says.) But after some discussion, one finally said, “We have now been effectively notified that there are individuals who did not receive the services that they actually needed, and compensating them for that shortcoming feels like the right thing to do.” It would also “place DHS on the right side of the story.”

The judge in the federal court case ultimately ruled that the state had insufficiently implemented the program. The state also subsequently made changes to help people understand the system, including lists that showed exactly what items on their assessments changed from year to year. But De Liban says there was a larger issue: people weren’t given enough help in general. While the algorithm sets the proportions for care — one care level, for example, might be two or three times higher than another — it’s the state’s decision to decide how many hours to insert into the equation.

“How much is given is as much a political as a service administration issue,” Mor says.

Fries says there’s no best practice for alerting people about how an algorithm works. “It’s probably something we should do,” he said when I asked whether his group should find a way to communicate the system. “Yeah, I also should probably dust under my bed.” Afterward, he clarified that he thought it was the job of the people implementing the system.

De Liban says the process for people appealing their cuts has been effectively worthless for most. Out of 196 people who appealed a decision at one point before the ruling, only nine won, and most of those were Legal Aid clients fighting on procedural grounds. While it’s hard to know, De Liban says it’s very possible some had errors they weren’t aware of.

Eubanks, the author of Automating Inequality, writes about the “digital poorhouse,” showing the ways automation can give a new sheen to long-standing mistreatment of the vulnerable. She told me there is a “natural trust” that computer-based systems will produce unbiased, neutral results. “I’m sure it is in some cases, but I can say with a fair amount of confidence it is not as descriptive or predictive as the advocates of these systems claim,” she says.

Eubanks proposes a test for evaluating algorithms directed toward the poor, including asking whether the tool increases their agency and whether it would be acceptable to use with wealthier people. It doesn’t seem obvious that the Arkansas system would pass that test. In one sign officials have been disappointed with the system, they’ve said they will soon migrate to a new system and software provider, likely calculating hours in a different way, although it’s not clear exactly what that will mean for people in the program.

Dobbs has done well up until now. Her house sits off a winding road on a lakeside hill, dotted in winter with barren trees. When the sun sets in the afternoon, light pours in through the windows and catches the plant collection Dobbs manages with help from an aide. A scruffy, sweatered dog named Spike hopped around excitedly when I visited recently, as a fluffy cat jockeyed for attention. “Sometimes I like them better than humans,” Dobbs says. On the wall was a collection of Duck Dynasty memorabilia and a framed photo of her with Kenny Rogers from when she worked at the Missouri building then known as the Kenny Rogers United Cerebral Palsy Center.

For the time being, she’s stuck in limbo. She’ll soon come up for another reassessment, and while it’s almost certain, based on what is known about the system, that she’ll be given a cut, it’s hard to say how severe it will be. She’s been through the process more than once now. Her hours were briefly restored after a judge ruled in the plaintiffs’ favor in the federal lawsuit, only for them to be cut again after the state changed its notification system to comply with the ruling and reimplemented the algorithm. As she went through an appeal, the Department of Human Services, De Liban says, quietly reinstated her hours again. This, he says, was right around the time the cerebral palsy issue was discovered. He says this may have been the reason it was dropped: to save face. But as many people grappling with the changes might understand, it’s hard to know for sure....",America,2015.09.25,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/111,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The facial recognition site PimEyes is one of the most capable face-searching tools on the planet. In less than a second, it can scan through more than 900 million images from across the Internet and find matches with startling accuracy.

But its most distinguishing trait is who can use it: Anyone. While most facial recognition tools are reserved for police or government use, PimEyes is open to the masses, whether they’re hunting down U.S. Capitol riot suspects or stalking women around the Web.

The search tool stands at the frontier of a new era of facial recognition surveillance: Powerfully sophisticated and available to anyone, with added abilities for those who pay. And without public oversight or government rules controlling facial recognition use, researchers expect that sites like PimEyes will multiply, capitalizing on the Internet’s vast bounty of photos and videos — and making it possible for strangers to keep tabs on people’s personal lives.

“What is stopping them? Literally nothing,” said Stephanie Hare, a technology researcher in London.

“The people who put those pictures on the Internet — with their children, their parents, the people who might be vulnerable in their life — were not doing it so they could feed a database that companies could monetize,” she said. There’s no clear way to fight back, she added: “I can leave my phone at home. What I can’t leave is my face.”

Facial recognition has become an increasingly widespread investigative tool for government authorities and law enforcement; airports, stores and schools also use it to verify visitors’ identities and boost security. But PimEyes has made it easier than ever for the general public to tap its artificial intelligence power: When a user submits a photo of someone’s face, the site will return a catalogue of images linked to other places where that person appears around the Web, including old videos, news stories, photo albums and personal blogs.

The search results don’t include exact names, but they offer a detail and precision that has left some people stunned. Pete, a 40-year-old man in Germany who asked that only his first name be used, said he ran a 17-year-old photo of himself drinking a beer on a train and was blown away when it returned a link to a recent video of him on YouTube.

“How did it even work? I’m older, it’s a different facial expression, even a different position of my head,” he said, comparing the two photos. “It’s very creepy and way too powerful. This should not be in the public, available for everyone.”

PimEyes says in its online “manifesto” that it believes searching for one’s face online should be a basic human right open to anyone, not just corporations and governments, and that the company’s work is, counterintuitively, a boon for privacy. PimEyes sells subscription packages to people who want to find where their photos have been posted online or get alerted when they’re posted somewhere else.

Though they’ve built a search engine devoted to unraveling online mysteries, the developers won’t say practically anything about themselves. A representative for the company — who declined to share their name, said they’d talk only over email and asked to be referred to only as “the director” — declined to answer questions about how PimEyes works, who is involved with the company or even where the company is based.

“Staying completely anonymous is very important to us,” the director said.

The company has defended itself against criticism — and data-privacy laws like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which restricts facial recognition use — by saying it is to be used only by people uploading their own images. But PimEyes enforces that rule with a single checkbox that anyone can easily click to circumvent. The company has no other rules in place to prevent anyone from scouring the Web for someone else.

“The most valuable resource is information … [and] we allow people to find, monitor, and protect pieces of information about themselves,” the director said. “We don’t encourage people to search for other people — it is their own decision to break the rules.”

The tool has become wildly popular among strangers looking to “essentially stalk” women around the Web, said Aaron DeVera, a security researcher in New York. On 4chan and other anonymous forums, PimEyes subscribers with deeper search capabilities than unpaid users — subscriptions start at around $30 a month — routinely create threads offering to search out any photo and relay back the results.

Almost all of the photos are of young girls and women pulled from their social media accounts, their dating-app profiles or “creepshots” stealthily photographed without their consent. The people searching often hope to find other photos or learn more personal details “so they can creep on them further,” DeVera added: “Something like this that is so off-the-shelf really does lower the barrier to entry for nefarious activity.”

In one PimEyes thread on 4chan from October, an anonymous user posted a digital collage, titled “Complete Exposure” and a woman’s name, filled with sensitive details of their personal life. It was unclear whether all the photos had been surfaced by PimEyes, or even whether they were all of the same woman. But the collage was scarily comprehensive, including photos of her standing in the middle-school classroom where she teaches, her driver’s license, school badge, wedding announcement, the outside of her home and her home address. (The woman, through her husband, declined to comment.)

The director said PimEyes should not be blamed for how it’s used by people on a forum like 4chan: “You will probably find some content there that shows how to use Google, a car, or just a plate or any other tool to hurt someone.”

Most facial recognition tools, such as Clearview AI, look for matches to an image among photos in a giant database. But PimEyes works more like Google, using bots known as “spiders” to crawl the Web, scanning for photos of faces and then recording those images as numerical code. If the search tool is later shown a photo that resembles one of those images, it will return a direct link to where the image can be found.

PimEyes said last year in a since-deleted webpage that it had analyzed 900 million unique faces — nearly three times the U.S. population — from 150 million websites and processed 1 terabyte of images everyday.

PimEyes said it does not search images on social media, but photos from those sites are regularly among the results, and in a test last year by the German digital-rights blog Netzpolitik, journalists said they found results from Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and TikTok. The company did not offer an explanation, the journalists wrote, adding, “The more we confront PimEyes with questions, the more the company contradicts itself.”

PimEyes’ bots do, however, catalogue the images on pornographic websites, and people who have used the site said they’ve often stumbled across those look-alike results when searching for someone else. The company director said the site scans porn images so its customers can find nonconsensual “revenge” porn postings or attempt “to erase the mistakes of youth.” One customer who creates sexual content, the director added, uses the tool to find websites that steal their work.

Launched in 2017 by a Polish start-up, PimEyes advertises itself as “an advanced self-monitoring, self-protection and self-image management tool.” A Polish blog in 2019 said the site was started by two graduates of the Wrocław University of Science and Technology, Lukasz Kowalczyk and Denis Tatina, who built it as a hobby project and later monetized it upon seeing the user interest — the greatest of which, they said, came from the United States.

In 2020, the PimEyes brand was transferred to Face Recognition Solutions Ltd., a company with no real online presence and a corporate address registered to a single room in the Seychelles, the island nation in the Indian Ocean that has become a popular offshore haven for companies wanting to obscure their ownership and corporate details.

The same room is also listed as a registered address for start-ups in advertising, finance and cryptocurrency, corporate records show. The PimEyes director said the company chose the Seychelles “because of the good incorporation environment.”

The director also offered little about how PimEyes’s facial recognition algorithms work, saying only that they are “built in-house.” Hundreds of such algorithms have been developed around the world, each with varying features and error rates that can affect how well they work: In a 2019 federal test, the least-accurate algorithms were up to 100 times more likely to misidentify people of color.

Users have been surprised when PimEyes found not just their own photos, but photos they hadn’t even realized they’d been captured in. A French journalist ran a webcam photo of himself through the site and found a photo he had no memory of, in which it looked like he’d fallen asleep during a news conference. Another man said the site had found a photo of him from 25 years ago.

Some have also been alarmed by the ease of use: One man tweeted that he had taken screenshots of people’s faces while on Zoom calls, then ran them through PimEyes, saying “the results were startling.” If he’d wanted, he added, he could have paid to get notifications any time a new photo of them was put online.

The service, though, could suffer from the same issues that plague many facial recognition tools, including wide swings in accuracy depending on the skin color of who’s being searched. Some Twitter users have complained that the search engine returned only porn actors who looked nothing like them.

The company declined to answer questions about its development team, finances, customer base, photo index and expansion plans. In March, the company offered to connect The Washington Post with some of its clients, saying “we have many customers who are satisfied with our service,” but after several weeks reversed course and said none would agree to talk.

“We help our customers solving sensitive cases, so they might not be willing to share their stories,” the director said.

Any PimEyes user can see some limited search results. But only paying “Premium” subscribers can perform unlimited searches, unlock the full image details and get email alerts whenever the site detects a face they’ve uploaded somewhere else on the Web. For $29.99 a month, a user can search 25 times a day, while $299.99 a month can unlock unlimited searches. An online pricing calculator suggests some users may want to conduct up to 100 million searches a month — a gargantuan number for a business that says users should search only for their own images.

PimEyes has advertised itself as a law-enforcement investigative tool, saying last year in a since-deleted post that it “is actively involved in the fight against online crime.” But the company director said that none of its customers are law enforcement agencies. That crime-fighting claim, the director said, is nevertheless “true in some way” because the tool can be used to find illegally used images.

PimEyes allows anyone to request a photo’s removal using an online form, one image at a time. But to completely block those photos from showing up in PimEyes’s search results, a user needs to pay $79.99 a month for the “PROtect” package — in essence, paying the same company that uncovered the images to also take them down.

PimEyes’s widespread use in the pursuit of Capitol rioters, by an online crowdsourced collective of “sedition hunters,” has also worried researchers like Hare, the technology researcher, who believed it could be easily misused to target the wrong people or turn untrained sleuths into digital vigilantes.

“Are citizens cops? No. But tools like these can turn anyone into a cop,” she said. “If you give people something that can be used as a surveillance tool, people are going to use it as one, and they’re not going to feel the need to have an ethical conversation about it.”

A tool for amateur detective work, Hare added, can also easily be transformed into a weapon of state surveillance. Before PimEyes, there was FindFace, a similar face-search engine developed by the Moscow tech start-up NtechLab. Russian authorities now use the software to track opposition activists, journalists, protesters and others captured by Moscow’s more than 189,000 cameras.

PimEyes said that instances of abuse tied to the search tool were not the company’s fault, adding that any “service can be used against the purpose it was created for.” Of the “sedition hunters,” the director said, “People who misused our search engine did that for a good cause, but it doesn’t mean they won’t face the consequences of their actions.”

But even some fans of the service think it goes too far. Conor Nolan, a photo researcher in London, spent hours on PimEyes attempting to identify members of the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, believing the information could prove invaluable to the FBI. On one of his first searches, PimEyes pointed to one suspect’s decade-old mug shot — an investigative breakthrough in a single click.

Nolan said it’s scarily accurate and “a technology I’m not comfortable with at all,” adding that he thinks governments should regulate such tools before they are made available to the general public. But in the meantime, he said, he intends to keep using it, just because it works so well.

“Ethics aside, it was well worth it,” Nolan said. “I’d use it again if I had the need.”

In the U.S., PimEyes and other facial recognition companies have few laws to worry about. While members of Congress from both parties have talked about freezing government use of the technology, and federal watchdogs at the Government Accountability Office last year urged them to strengthen face-scan laws, the business is still entirely unregulated at the national level.

Half a dozen states and roughly two dozen cities have banned or restricted the technology for public use; another dozen state legislatures are slated to discuss similar bills this year. But such legislation almost always addresses use by police or public authorities, not companies or private individuals.

That regulatory void has led even the technology’s biggest developers to call for stronger laws: Amazon last summer halted its sale of facial recognition technology to police for one year to give lawmakers “enough time to implement appropriate rules,” while Microsoft said it would not sell the technology to police until a federal law is enacted that is “grounded in human rights.”

Some AI researchers expect PimEyes won’t be the last site to attempt unbounded facial search. The rise of “open source” AI has allowed outside developers to easily fold facial recognition software into their own applications: With enough computing power, anyone can use them to play around with the seemingly infinite photo and video data of the Web.

One AI data scientist using the online name “Patr10tic,” who spoke in a phone interview on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the development of similar tools, said PimEyes’s functionality can be closely mimicked using freely available tools such as FaceNet, an open-source facial recognition system developed by Google researchers in 2015 and now widely emulated around the Web.

After the Capitol siege, he used an open-source “face extractor” tool to pull out facial images from more than 40,000 videos uploaded to the heavily pro-Trump social network Parler. He then built a cluster map of those faces, as well as a detailed location map pinpointing where the videos had first been made.

Developers, he said, have a “real duty” to build tools with guardrails against their own misuse. But he’s not surprised that such AI uses are expanding rapidly — and he believes that, in many cases, it’s already too late to rein in a type of technology that’s widely proliferated around the world.

“You’re not going to be able to stop people from ‘spidering’ the Web on their own and using open-source code to build pipelines like this. It’s just impossible to enforce,” he said. “That’s where the world is going. Like the physicists of the 1940s, we can already effectively create a Manhattan Project. All these tools can be used, so to speak, for peace or for war.”",Global,2016.01.01,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/110,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3. News coverage: Experts in the AI ​​research community, lawyers and even law enforcement are calling on Congress to suspend real-world use of the software. Several projects have shown that the algorithms involved often struggle to accurately identify women and people of color.

In Maine, for example, state officials cannot use the technology and cannot contract with third parties. The software cannot be used except in cases involving serious crimes or searches for registered vehicles. Elsewhere, in Portland, Oregon, facial recognition cameras aren't allowed in any public or private setting, from grocery stores to train stations.
However, many states are quite lax about this. Banks in Florida and North Carolina use systems to monitor customers and, in some cases, chase out homeless people wandering outside. """,Negative,No information about this case,"A local roller skating rink is coming under fire for its use of facial recognition software after a teenager was banned for allegedly getting into a brawl there.

""To me, it's basically racial profiling,"" said the girl's mother Juliea Robinson. ""You're just saying every young Black, brown girl with glasses fits the profile and that's not right.""

Juliea and her husband Derrick are considering legal action against a Livonia skating rink after their daughter Lamya was misidentified by the business's facial recognition technology.

""I was like, that is not me. who is that?"" said Lamya Robinson.

Lamya's mom dropped her off at Riverside Arena skating rink last Saturday to hang out with friends, but staffers barred her entry saying she was banned after her face was scanned - saying Lamya was involved in a brawl at the skating rink back in March.
But there was one problem.
""I was so confused because I've never been there,"" said Lamya.
The Robinsons' beef with Riverside comes as facial recognition technology undergoes more scrutiny. Robert Williams, one of the first in the country to be misidentified and wrongfully arrested over the technology, testified on Capitol Hill Tuesday.
""I just don't think it's right, that my picture was used in some type of lineup, and I never been in trouble,"" Williams said.
Tawana Petty heads up Data 4 Black Lives, one of 35 organizations signing onto a campaign calling for retailers to not use facial recognition on customers or workers in their stores.
According to campaign organizers, Lowes and Macy's are among those using the technology.
Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, and Target are among those that are not.
""Facial recognition does not accurately recognize darker skin tones,"" Petty said. ""So, I don't want to go to Walmart and be tackled by an officer or security guard, because they misidentified me for something I didn't do.""
The Robinsons say they are thankful the situation did not lead to an unnecessary interaction with police.
Riverside made Lamya leave the building after misidentifying her, putting her safety, the Robinsons say, at risk.
""You all put my daughter out of the establishment by herself, not knowing what could have happened,"" said Derrick Robinson. ""It just happened to be a blessing that she was calling in frustration to talk to her cousin, but at the same time he pretty much said I'm not that far, let me go see what's wrong with her.""
We have a statement from the skating rink which reads in part:
""One of our managers asked Ms. Robinson (Lamya's mother) to call back sometime during the week. He explained to her, this our usual process, as sometimes the line is quite long and it's a hard look into things when the system is running.
""The software had her daughter at a 97 percent match. This is what we looked at, not the thumbnail photos Ms. Robinson took a picture of, if there was a mistake, we apologize for that.""

IPVM also recently found 12 government projects from the last few years that mandate Uighur analytics across the country. These show that the persecution of the Muslim minority group spreads way beyond the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in north-western China.

Satellite images, leaked documents, and personal accounts of former detainees of “re-education” camps depict a range of systematic human rights violations in the country that are being turbocharged by tech.

IVPM’s latest report adds further evidence of the prevalence of one of the most egregious examples: “ethnicity detection” software.

The group revealed that Huawei, facial recognition firm Megvii, and several other Chinese tech firms have filed patents “for various devices and systems that include Uighur and ethnic minority detection.”

Huawei’s ‘target object’ patent

The Huawei patent describes AI techniques for identifying pedestrians by attributes including “race (Han [China’s biggest ethnic group], Uighur).”

It was originally filed in July 2018 by Huawei and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

Huawei told IVPM that the Uighur detection “should never have become part of the [patent] application” and that the firm is “taking proactive steps to amend” it.

Beyond Huawei

IPVM also flagged patents filed by Megvii and AI giant SenseTime for systems capable of recognizing Uighurs. Megvii told the BBC it would “withdraw” the patent.

SenseTime said its patent was “regrettable” and that the firm would “update” it “at the next available opportunity on record.”

IPVM further revealed patents filed by Chinese tech firms Alibaba and Baibu that mention classification by ethnicity, although neither refers specifically to Uighurs.

Alibaba told IVPM that “ethnic discrimination… violates our policies and values, while Huawei said it had “never developed or permitted its technology to profile any ethnic group.”

Korean firm Scatter Lab has defended its Lee Luda chatbot in response to calls to end the service after the bot began sending offensive comments and was subjected to sexual messages.

Kim Jong-yoon, CEO of Scatter Lab, posted answers Friday to the public’s questions through the development team’s official blog, saying the bot was still a work in progress and -- like humans -- would take a while to properly socialize.

Kim acknowledged that he had expected this controversy to ignite, adding, “There is no big difference between humans swearing at or sexually harassing an AI, whether the user is a female or male, or whether the AI is set as a male or female.”

Kim wrote that based on the company’s prior service experience, it was quite obvious that humans would have socially unacceptable interactions with the AI.

Luda, an AI-driven Facebook Messenger chat service that mimics a 20-year-old woman, was developed by Scatter Lab and launched in December. It is designed to provide a similar experience to talking to a real person through a mobile messenger.

Luda was initially set not to accept certain keywords or expressions that could be problematic to social norms and values. But according to Kim, such a system has its limitations in that it is impossible to prevent all inappropriate conversations with an algorithm that simply filters keywords.

“We plan to apply the first results within the first quarter of this year, using hostile attacks as a material for training our AI.”

When asked about the reason Luda was set as a 20-year-old female college student, Kim said, “We are considering both male and female chatbots. Due to the development schedule, however, Luda, the female version, simply came out first.”

Luda is believed to use “mesh autoencoders,” a natural language processing technology introduced by Google. The initial input data for Luda’s deep learning AI consisted of 10 billion KakaoTalk messages shared between actual couples.

After the launch, several online community boards posted messages such as those titled, “How to make Luda a sex slave,” with screen-captured images of sexual conversations with the AI.

Other conversations with Luda shared online included homophobic or other discriminatory expressions by the chatbot. Luda responded to words that defined homosexuals, such as “lesbian,” saying, “I really hate them, they look disgusting, and it‘s creepy.”

It’s not the first time AI has been linked to discrimination and bigotry.

In 2016, Microsoft shut down its chatbot Tay within 16 hours, as some users of an anonymous bulletin board used by Islamophobes and white supremacists deliberately trained Tay to say racist things.

In 2018, Amazon also completely suspended its AI recruitment tool after finding it made recommendations that were biased against women.

But Kim denied the idea that this was a repetition of the Tay incident, saying, “Luda will not immediately apply the conversation with the users to its learning system,” and insisted that it would go through a process of giving appropriate learning signals gradually, to acknowledge the difference between what is OK and what is not.

Meanwhile, some are questioning how Scatter Lab secured 10 billion KakaoTalk messages in the first place. Scatter Lab gained attention in the industry with its service called The Science of Love -- an application that analyzes the degree of affection between partners by submitting actual KakaoTalk conversations.

Scatter Lab explained earlier that there was no leakage of personal information in the service, but concerns remain, as keeping such a vast database, including conversations with Luda, carries the possibility that personal information could be leaked in the future.

Critics also argue that Luda is degenerating into a tool for users to carry out discrimination and acts of hatred, and calls are growing for the company to shut down the service....",China,2018.07.20,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/107,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen-year-old Jovani, who had been in the front passenger seat and not wearing his seatbelt, was thrown from the Ford and died, according to a police report.

The accident, which took place four miles from Tesla’s main car factory, is now the subject of a lawsuit against the company. It is one of a growing number of crashes involving Autopilot that have fueled concerns about the technology’s shortcomings, and could call into question the development of similar systems used by rival carmakers. And as cars take on more tasks previously done by humans, the development of these systems could have major ramifications — not just for the drivers of those cars but for other motorists, pedestrians and cyclists.

Tesla, founded in 2003, and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have been bold in challenging the auto industry, attracting devoted fans and customers and creating a new standard for electric vehicles that other established carmakers are reckoning with. The company is worth more than several large automakers combined.

But the accidents involving Autopilot could threaten Tesla’s standing and force regulators to take action against the company. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has about two dozen active investigations into crashes involving Autopilot.

At least three Tesla drivers have died since 2016 in crashes in which Autopilot was engaged and failed to detect obstacles in the road. In two instances, the system did not brake for tractor-trailers crossing highways. In the third, it failed to recognize a concrete barrier. In June, the federal traffic safety agency released a list showing that at least 10 people have been killed in eight accidents involving Autopilot since 2016. That list does not include the crash that killed Jovani Maldonado.

Tesla’s credibility has taken a hit, and some experts on autonomous driving say that it is hard not to question other claims made by Mr. Musk and the company. He has, for example, said several times that Tesla was close to perfecting Full Self Driving, a technology that would allow cars to drive autonomously in most circumstances — something other auto and technology companies have said is years away.

Mr. Musk and Tesla did not respond to several requests for comment.

Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system. Rather, it is a suite of software, cameras and sensors intended to assist drivers and prevent accidents by taking over many aspects of driving a car — even the changing of lanes. Tesla executives have claimed that handing off these functions to computers will make driving safer because human drivers are prone to mistakes and distractions, and cause most of the roughly 40,000 traffic fatalities that occur each year in the United States.

“Computers don’t check their Instagram” while driving, Tesla’s director of artificial intelligence, Andrej Karpathy, said last month in an online workshop on autonomous driving.

While Autopilot is in control, drivers can relax, but are not supposed to tune out. Instead, they’re supposed to keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road, ready to take over in case the system becomes confused or fails to recognize objects or dangerous traffic scenario.

But with little to do other than look straight ahead, some drivers seem unable to resist the temptation to let their attention wander while Autopilot is on. Videos have been posted on Twitter and elsewhere showing drivers reading or sleeping while at the wheel of Teslas.

The company has often faulted drivers of its cars, blaming them in some cases for failing to keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road while using Autopilot.

But the National Transportation Safety Board, which has completed investigations into accidents involving Autopilot, has said the system lacks safeguards to prevent misuse and does not effectively monitor drivers.

Similar systems offered by General Motors, Ford Motor and other automakers use cameras to track a driver’s eyes and issue warnings when they look away from the road. After a few warnings, G.M.’s Super Cruise system shuts down and requires the driver to take control.

Autopilot does not track drivers’ eyes and monitors only if their hands are on the steering wheel. The system sometimes continues operating even if drivers have their hands on the steering wheel for only a few seconds at a time.

“This monitoring system is fundamentally weak because it’s easy to cheat and doesn’t monitor very consistently,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who focuses on autonomous driving technology.

Consumer Reports said in May that one of its engineers had been able to turn on Autopilot in a Tesla and slip into the back seat while the car kept going. The California Highway Patrol said in May that it had arrested a man who got out of the driver’s seat of his Model 3 while it was moving.

Autopilot can also be used on city roads, where intersections, pedestrians and oncoming traffic make driving more difficult than on highways. G.M.’s Super Cruise works only on divided highways.

Still, Mr. Musk has often defended Autopilot. The company has cited its own statistics to claim that cars driving with the system turned on are involved in fewer accidents per mile than other cars. Last Thursday, he wrote on Twitter, that “accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer.”

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not forced Tesla to change or disable Autopilot, but in June it said it would require all automakers to report accidents involving such systems.

Several lawsuits have been filed against Tesla just this year, including one in April in Florida state court that concerns a 2019 crash in Key Largo. A Tesla Model S with Autopilot on failed to stop at a T intersection and crashed into a Chevrolet Tahoe parked on a shoulder, killing Naibel Leon, 22. Another suit was filed in California in May by Darel Kyle, 55, who suffered serious spinal injuries when a Tesla under Autopilot control rear-ended the van he was driving.

The crash that killed Jovani Maldonado is a rare case when video and data from the Tesla car have become available. The Maldonados’ lawyer, Benjamin Swanson, obtained them from Tesla and shared both with The New York Times.

Mr. Maldonado and his wife, Adriana Garcia, filed their suit in Alameda County Superior Court. Their complaint asserts that Autopilot contains defects and failed to react to traffic conditions. The suit also names as defendants the driver of the Tesla, Romeo Lagman Yalung of Newark, Calif., and his wife, Vilma, who owns the car and was in the front passenger seat.

Mr. Yalung and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. He and his wife, who were not reported injured in the accident, have not yet addressed the Maldonado family’s complaint in court.

In court filings, Tesla has not yet responded to the allegation that Autopilot malfunctioned or is flawed. In emails to Mr. Swanson’s firm that have been filed as exhibits in court, a Tesla lawyer, Ryan McCarthy, said the driver, not Tesla, bore responsibility.

“The police faulted the Tesla driver — not the car — for his inattention and his driving at an unsafe speed,” Mr. McCarthy wrote. He did not respond to emails seeking comment.

Mr. Maldonado works for PepsiCo, delivering beverages to retailers. The family, which includes two other children, lives in San Lorenzo, about 15 miles north of Fremont.

In written answers to questions, Mr. Maldonado said he and his wife were too devastated to talk in an interview. “We are living day by day,” he said. “There is so much sadness inside. We take family walks and try to do things together like going to church. There is a massive hole in the family.”

Mr. Maldonado described his son as an outgoing high school sophomore who liked to sing and planned to go to college. His dream was to become a professional soccer player and buy his parents a house. “Like any grateful child, he wanted to take care of his parents like they did for him,” Mr. Maldonado said.

The data and video allow a detailed look at how Autopilot operated in the seconds before the crash. Tesla vehicles constantly record short clips from forward-looking cameras. If a crash occurs, the video is automatically saved and uploaded to Tesla’s servers, a company official said in emails included in exhibits filed by Mr. Swanson.

The video saved by the car Mr. Yalung was driving shows it passing vehicles on the right and left. Four seconds before impact, Mr. Maldonado turned on his blinker. It flashed four times while his Explorer was in its original lane. A fifth flash came as his truck was straddling the lanes. In court documents, Mr. Maldonado said he had noticed the Tesla approaching rapidly in his rearview mirror and tried to swerve back.

In most of the video, the Tesla maintained a speed of 69 miles per hour, but just before impact it briefly increased to 70 m.p.h. then slowed in the final second, according to data from the car.

Mr. Rajkumar of Carnegie Mellon, who reviewed the video and data at the request of The Times, said Autopilot might have failed to brake for the Explorer because the Tesla’s cameras were facing the sun or were confused by the truck ahead of the Explorer. The Tesla was also equipped with a radar sensor, but it appears not to have helped.

“A radar would have detected the pickup truck, and it would have prevented the collision,” Mr. Rajkumar said in an email. “So the radar outputs were likely not being used.”

Mr. Maldonado’s truck rolled over and slammed into a barrier, the police report said. It had a shattered windshield and a crumpled roof, and the rear axle had come loose. The Tesla had a crumpled roof, its front end was mangled, its bumper was partly detached, and its windshield was cracked.

When algorithmic systems and other technology systems are deployed to reach policy goals, we must all be mindful that the way those systems are built and used can produce drastically different outcomes. Here, the consequences of California building an algorithm to allocate vaccines based on ZIP codes rather than census tracts means that more than 2 million Californians—living in neighborhoods with the worst health outcomes, many of them communities of color—may not be given needed additional vaccine supply.

Both Governor Newsom and the California Department of Public Health have recognized that “the pandemic did not affect California communities equally.” COVID-19 has devastated Black, Latinx, and other communities of color at disproportionate rates, with Latinx people representing close to the majority of COVID-19 deaths. To advance the goal of equity in vaccine distribution, the state decided in January to use something called the “Healthy Places Index”—a metric that assigns scores to communities across California according to health outcomes—in order to identify areas of the state where additional supply of the vaccine is necessary. Under the state's plans, additional vaccine supply would go to the areas with Healthy Places Index scores in the bottom 25%.

A few weeks later, the state announced that Blue Shield would build an algorithm allocating vaccines based on ZIP codes rather than census tracts—the generally smaller, census-based areas that the Healthy Places Index scores with health outcomes.

The use of ZIP codes to allocate vaccines should give us pause. ZIP codes are designed primarily to accelerate the delivery of the mail, while census tracts are specifically designed for making place-based socioeconomic comparisons. Given this difference, California should have a compelling reason to use ZIP codes rather than census tracts to deliver vaccine supply to communities that need it.

So what are the potential real-life consequences of California’s algorithm and its use of ZIP codes to allocate vaccine supply?

Our analysis shows that using ZIP codes rather than census tracks in the algorithm could transform which communities get additional vaccine supply, potentially undermining equity and access for many vulnerable communities. The problem lies in the fact that ZIP codes often represent much larger geographical areas, containing both low-income and wealthy communities. As a result, a low-income, underserved neighborhood with a very low Healthy Places Index score can end up erased from the state’s priority list by virtue of the fact that they are in the same ZIP code with higher-income households.

The map below shows this impact for communities across the state. Blue areas represent ZIP codes that, according to the state, may get additional supply of vaccines. Red areas are census tracts in the least healthy 25% of the Healthy Places Index that fall outside of these prioritized ZIP codes, which apparently won't receive additional supply under the state's equity framework.

According to the 2010 census over 2 million people lived in the red census tracts in this map. They are neighborhoods across the state, from communities in the most Northern reaches of the state, like Susanville in Lassen County, to Chinatown in downtown San Francisco, to El Cajon northeast of San Diego. You can explore the results of the state’s distribution algorithm in your own community in the map above.

For these excluded communities, familiar disparities reveal themselves. The census tracts that, if the state’s plans are carried out, will not receive additional vaccine supply are disproportionately communities of color. Statewide, Latinx people make up approximately 38% of the population, but Latinx people make up 53% of the population in the census tracts that may be omitted from the state’s equity focus. The same is true of Black populations, making up 6% statewide but 8% of the census tracts potentially left behind.

The state has been admirably transparent regarding the decision to use ZIP codes rather than census tracts, stating that tracking vaccine delivery to ZIP codes is operationally simpler than using census tracts. But the consequences of that choice, when built into an algorithm that will determine which communities in California have additional supply of the vaccine, are literally life and death. Today’s results are meant to clarify the potential impact of the state’s decision for the people of California.

Our analysis focuses on the geographic boundaries used by the state to distribute additional vaccine doses. But other aspects of the state’s equity algorithm are worth scrutinizing. Public-health and equity experts have counseled, for example, that Black people should be explicitly prioritized in vaccine delivery. And recent research suggests that direct prioritization of high-risk racial and ethnic groups in vaccine distribution performs better than age-based or geographic targeting. Other available metrics, like the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index, the Index of Concentration at the Extremes, and the COVID-19 Vulnerability Indicators consider different factors to determine a place-based vulnerability score and advance equity as the vaccine is distributed.

When algorithmic or other technological systems are part of public policy, the public has a right to know what information is being used and why, how they work, and what the consequences will be for every person touched by the system. Unfortunately, if the state’s description of the “equity” algorithm is correct, it falls short of that mark. Algorithmic systems can cloak human decisions in a guise of objectivity, but every decision made by a computer was, at bottom, made by the people who designed, built, and deployed those systems.

Distributing supply of a scarce vaccine in a pandemic is no easy task. The ideal approach, in which everyone who needs and wants the vaccine has immediate access, is not always possible. But when algorithmic systems are used to distribute scarce resources in California and around the country, we must be brutally honest about the consequences of those algorithms on people’s lives. Technology can alleviate harm, but it can also exacerbate existing inequality. The research results we release today are meant to advance California towards both transparency and equity and ensure that technology is powering—not undermining—social justice.

Today, we call on the California Department of Public Health to review the 469 census tracts where 2 million Californians live, and explain how the state will ensure that those people, many of whom are in dire need of life-saving medical care, will not be left behind....",America,2019.08.24,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/105,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several users posted a lot of photos to show that in an image that has people with different colors, Twitter chooses to show folks with lighter skin after cropping those images to fit its display parameters on its site and embeds. Some of them even tried to reproduce results with fictional characters and dogs.

If you tap on these images, you’ll see an uncropped version of the image which includes more details such as another person or character. What’s odd is that even if users flipped the order of where dark-skinned and light-skinned people appeared in the image, the results were the same.

However, some people noted that there might be other factors than the color of the skin. And they who tried different methods found inconsistent results.

Twitter’s Chief Design Officer (CDO), Dantley Davis, said that the choice of cropping sometimes takes brightness of the background into consideration.

In a thread, Bianca Kastl, a developer from Germany, explained that Twitter’s algorithm might be cropping the image based on saliency — an important point or part in an image that you’re likely to look at first when you see it.

Probably Twitters Crop algorithm is a pretty simple Saliency. We will see… pic.twitter.com/q4R0R8h3vh

Her theory is backed by Twitter’s 2018 blog post that explained its neural network built for image cropping. The post notes that earlier, the company took facial detection into account to crop images. However, that approach didn’t work for images that didn’t have a face in them. So the social network switched to a saliency-based algorithm.

Even if Twitter’s algorithm is not ‘racist,’ enough people have posted examples showing the algorithm appears biased towards lighter skin tones, and the results are problematic.. The company definitely needs to do some digging into their algorithm to understand the bias in its neural network. Anima Anandkumar, Director of AI research at Nvidia, pointed out that the saliency algorithm might be trained using eye-tracking of straight male participants, and that would insert more bias into the algorithm.

Forced to pay back money they didn’t owe, many families were driven to financial ruin, and some were torn apart. Others were left with lasting mental health issues; people of color were disproportionately the victims.

After relentless investigative reporting and a string of parliamentary hearings both preceding and following the mass resignations, the role of algorithms and automated systems in the scandal became clear, revealing how an austere and punitive war on low-level fraud was automated, leaving little room for accountability or basic human compassion. Even more, the automated system discriminated on the basis of nationality, flagging people with dual nationalities as being likely fraudsters.

The childcare benefits scandal (kinderopvangtoeslagaffaire in Dutch) is a cautionary tale of the havoc that black box algorithms can wreak, especially when they are weaponized to target society’s most vulnerable. It’s a problem that is not unique to the Netherlands: the Australian government faced its own “robodebt” scandal when its automated system for flagging benefits fraud stole nearly $1 billion from hundreds of thousands of innocent people. That case, too, came down to a poorly-designed algorithm without human oversight, an extension of cruel austerity politics with inexpressible collateral damage.

Here’s how the scandal unfolded.

Parents generally have to pay for childcare in the Netherlands. However, based on a parent’s income, the Dutch state reimburses a portion of the costs at the end of each month.

The fear of people gaming welfare systems is far from new and not particular to the Netherlands, but the rise of xenophobic far-right populism has placed it centerstage in the national political discourse. Anti-immigrant politics have become increasingly normalized, and immigrants are often painted as a threat to the Dutch welfare state.

Following this, a hardline stance regarding benefits fraud has become mostly politically uniform (even among many left-wing parties) over the past decade.

“Who pays the bill?” asked Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-immigrant Dutch Party for Freedom (the second largest party in the country), during a speech in 2008. “It’s the people of the Netherlands, the people who work hard, who properly save money and properly pay their taxes. The regular Dutch person does not receive money as a gift. Henk and Ingrid pay for Mohammed and Fatima.”

What followed was essentially a take-no-prisoners war on benefits and welfare fraud. Like many nations, the Netherlands has long automated aspects of its welfare system paired with human oversight and review. From 2013 on (though these techniques could have been used earlier), authorities used algorithms to create risk profiles of residents who were supposedly more likely to commit fraud and then used automated systems with little oversight to scan through benefits applicants and flag likely fraudsters who were then forced to pay money they didn’t owe in reality.

Before the increased use of automated systems, the decision to cut off a family from benefits payments would have to go through extensive review, said Marlies van Eck, an assistant professor at Radboud University who researches automated decision making in government agencies and who previously worked for the national benefits department. Now, such choices have increasingly been left to algorithms, or algorithms themselves have acted as their own form of review.

“Suddenly, with technology in reach, benefits decisions were made in a really unprecedented manner,” she said. “In the past, if you worked for the government with paper files, you couldn’t suddenly decide from one moment to the next to stop paying people benefits.”

After years of denial, an investigation from the Dutch Data Protection Authority found that these algorithms were inherently discriminatory because they took variables such as whether someone had a second nationality into account.

As devastating as the scandal is, it treads familiar territory. The Netherlands continues to pilot discriminatory predictive-policing technology that perpetuates ethnic profiling, for example.

Marc Schuilenburg is a professor in sociology and criminology at Vrije University in Amsterdam and author of the book Hysteria: Crime, Media, and Politics. Having spent a significant portion of his career studying the use of predictive policing algorithms, he argues that the child benefits scandal has to be seen within the context of this cultural and political shift towards punitive populism.

“The toeslagenaffaire [benefits scandal] is not an isolated problem,” Schuilenburg told Motherboard over Zoom. “It fits into a long tradition in the Netherlands of security policies that are designed to make clear that the days of tolerance are over, and that we are locked into this fight to the death with crimes such as welfare fraud. This fits into this whole notion of populist hysteria which I discuss in my book.”

“You see that these policies are spoken of in terms of war, in a hysterical military vocabulary—‘there is a war against fraud,’” he continued. “Through this language and these policies this brand of punishment populism prevails.”

For those classified by the automated system as a fraudster, few properly-done follow-up investigations meant that there was little recourse. In some cases, even something as simple as forgetting a signature landed families with the effectively irremovable label of having committed fraud. Once that label was there, they were forced to retroactively pay the government back for all the childcare benefits they had received, which amounted to thousands of euros for many and in some cases even tens of thousands of euros.

An investigation from Dutch daily newspaper Trouw also found that parents accused of fraud were given the label of “intent / gross negligence”, meaning that they weren’t even eligible for a payment scheme to gradually pay off their already false debts.

Victims were locked out of other benefits as well, such as the housing allowance and healthcare allowance. Many were forced to file for bankruptcy. The results were catastrophic.

“I believe in the States you have this saying ‘you’re one paycheck away from being homeless?’” van Eck told Motherboard over the phone. “Yeah, well that’s basically what we saw in this affair.”

“If you miss two or three months of payments, especially for the child care benefits, you may have to quit your job,” she explained. If someone quit their job to care for their children as a result, she said, they’d end up having financial difficulties. “There was this huge snowball effect because everything is connected with each other in the Netherlands. It was horrible.”

In one of the more egregious examples of the lack of humanity in the authorities’ approach, a report from Trouw revealed that the tax office had baselessly applied the mathematical Pareto principle to their punishments, assuming without evidence that 80 percent of the parents investigated for fraud were guilty and 20 percent were innocent.

The victims of the overzealous tax authorities were disproportionately people of color, highlighting how algorithms can perpetuate discriminatory structures and institutional racism.

According to Nadia Benaissa—a policy advisor at the digital rights group Bits of Freedom—, the fraud detection systems using variables like nationality can create problematic feedback loops similar to how predictive policing algorithms built on flawed assumptions can create a self-fulfilling prophecy that leads to the over-policing of minority groups.

Crucially, she said, we should place blame on the human individuals behind the creation and use of the algorithm rather than reify the technology as being the main driver.

“Systems and algorithms are human-made, and do exactly what they’ve been instructed to do,” she said. “They can act as an easy and sort of cowardly way to take the blame off yourself. What’s important to understand is that often algorithms can use historical data without any proper interpretation of the context surrounding that data. With that pattern, you can only expect social problems like institutional racism to increase. The result is a sort of feedback loop that increases social problems that already exist.”

While some efforts to increase algorithmic transparency have been made recently (such as an algorithm register from the municipality of Amsterdam), many of the automated systems in use in society remain opaque, said van Eck, even for researchers.

“Transparency is certainly a major issue. As a researcher, it’s difficult because these algorithms remain invisible,” van Eck said. “If I want to know something, I have trouble finding a person who can talk to me about it. And, if they just buy a software system, it could be that nobody actually knows how it works. Transparency is important not just for citizens, but also on the administrative level.”

Beyond transparency, safeguards and accountability are especially important when algorithms are given enormous power over people's livelihoods, but as of now little of that exists in the Netherlands. And, in the meantime, smart algorithms and automated systems continue to take over a larger and larger share of administrative procedures.

For now, the families wrongly accused of fraud are waiting to be given €30,000 each in compensation, but that won’t be enough to make up for the divorces, broken homes, and the psychological toll that resulted from the affair.

Meanwhile, despite the gravity of scandal, the resignation of Mark Rutte and his cabinet is largely symbolic. Though he resigned, he is still leading the government in the meantime and will be on the ballot in the national elections scheduled for next month. Rutte’s conservative VVD party is expected to win handily, meaning that both he and many of his ministers will likely return to their posts.

At the end of every government scandal, the words “never again” are thrown around a lot, but the combination of few strong ethical safeguards for algorithms and an increasingly automated government leaves those words with little meaning.",America,2020.03.23,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/102,,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, I receive several social benefits. The welfare office pays part of my rent and gives me a monthly stipend, which totals about 500€ a month. I’ve been working as an employee since 2007, and additionally registered as a freelance worker in 2020. I never had any trouble with the welfare office. I usually sends them a declaration every quarter. I know that my case can be checked, either by the welfare services or by the tax authorities.

On 17 March 2021, the welfare office sends me an email asking for new information, following the latest reform in welfare benefits. Although I have to send a year’s worth of documents about my income, I comply with the request. I send them the documents as well as a written explanation of my situation.

On the next day, I receive two e-mails, asking me to submit, again, the same documents. In addition, the welfare office tells me that I owe them 542 euros and that the amount will be automatically taken from my next payments, to the tune of 60 euros each month. Not the kind of amount that I can afford to spare. Despite my surprise and, let’s be honest, my rage, I notice what went wrong. The welfare office only took into account my status as a freelance worker and ignored my salaried work. This changes the way my benefits are computed, much to my detriment. I explain the mistake to the welfare office in an e-mail and book a phone appointment with my caseworker for 26 March.

A few hours later, someone from the welfare office leaves a message on my mailbox. She says that she read my e-mail, canceled my debt and closed the issue. I felt relieved after this emotional roller-coaster, but I wanted to find out how such a mistake could happen.

During my phone meeting on 26 March, my caseworker confirms that “the software” analyzed my file automatically, using “parameters”. My case apparently became “too complex” when I informed them that I started work as a freelance. It was entirely reset, hence the e-mail asking me to upload a year’s worth of documents.

Despite my caseworker’s answers, I still can’t understand why the software only took into account my activity as a freelance worker. All the more so because I sent all the necessary documents as required. My debt was notified as soon as the algorithm found an error in my file. The machine threatens first, humans verify later. Only the e-mail I sent let the welfare office know about their mistake. Their automated tools put me in a difficult position in the first place.

The welfare office offers explanations – sort of – on its website. Under the title “putting the facts right”, a page published in September 2020 says that controls actually benefit welfare recipients. They use “automated controls” as well as “a statistical model known as ‘datamining’ (sic), which automatically targets risky cases”. Notwithstanding the obscure jargon, it’s hard for any layperson to understand what they mean. The page also says that “you can avoid incurring debts towards the welfare office by always declaring any change in your situation without delay”. Except that in my case, I was notified of my debt precisely because I did that.

Welfare offices, which are run by the French regions, have been using data mining since 2012. The method is responsible for three in four controls. The most controlled benefit in 2021 is the one that helps beneficiaries pay for rent, which I receive.

I spoke to Vincent Dubois, a sociologist at the University of Strasbourg who recently published a book on the topic, “Controlling Welfare Queens” (Contrôler les assistés). “Technically, controls that are based on data mining do not use social characteristics but ‘risk factors’. They don’t identify individuals or specific groups, but cases,” he said. “Such targeting is not socially neutral. Risk factors are not distributed randomly among the population, were it only because the criteria and the attribution process vary across benefits, and beneficiaries are socially and economically different.” Although he has no definite proof, Mr Dubois thinks that women, especially single women such as myself, are considered ‘higher risk’. Other risk factors include living abroad or failing to tell about a new job, according to the welfare office.

The welfare office’s privacy policy states that the French data protection authority regularly controls how it handles personal data. But according to Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation, any automated treatment that has ‘legal impact’ is prohibited. French law goes further and states that any algorithmic decision is void if the fact that it was taken automatically is not clearly mentioned to the recipient. Needless to say, the e-mail from the welfare office notifying my debt made no mention of any automated process. The French data protection authority declined to answer my questions.",Netherlands,2018.09.01,https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/101,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
